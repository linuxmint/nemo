README for nautilus/libnautilus-extensions

This library, libnautilus-extensions, is totally private to nautilus.

If you are writing a nautilus component, you should not use this
library or link with it in any way.

Soon, libnautilus-extensions will be renamed to nautilus-internals to
emphazise the fact that this is code that is internal to nautilus and 
not available for public consumption.

If you think that there is something interesting in this library that
you would like to use in a third party component, please send mail to
the nautilus mailing list at:

nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com
