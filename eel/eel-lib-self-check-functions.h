/* Putting the prototypes for these self-check functions in each
   header file for the files they are defined in would make compiling
   the self-check framework take way too long (since one file would
   have to include everything).

   So we put the list of functions here instead.

   Instead of just putting prototypes here, we put this macro that
   can be used to do operations on the whole list of functions.
