	Mass refactoring of summary view code to make needed summary view
	fixes more managable. In the process, fixed bugs 4555 (Version
	display for featured softcat downloads) and 5795 (Summary View
	text doesn't wrap.) Also, cleaned up assorted pieces of text.

	Fixed bug 2131 (Change Nautilus to use OAF asynchronous activation
	interface). In making view activation work right, I also
	eliminated the state machine that was almost gone from
	NautilusWindow. There's still some additional simplification we
	can do, but it's simpler than it was. At the same time, made sure
	all incoming CORBA calls are deferred until idle time. This is
	most of what the old state machine was accomplishing, believe it
	or not, although it didn't do it 100%.

	Also fixes bug 2457 (Silent error loading content view), bug 2461
	(progress from old and new content view sometimes confused), and
	bug 6109 (Assertion hit on clicking the refresh button many times
	very quickly). Perhaps others too, we need to test some old bugs
	to see if they have changed behavior.

	(activation_handle_done), (activation_idle_callback),
	(activation_cancel), (oaf_activation_callback),

	I added to NautilusView so we can use it on the NautilusViewFrame
	side too.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view.c: (queue_incoming_call),
	(nautilus_view_initialize), (nautilus_view_destroy): Change to use
	the new NautilusIdleQueue so we can share code.

	(impl_Nautilus_ViewFrame_report_load_failed),
	(impl_Nautilus_ViewFrame_set_title): Deal with all incoming CORBA
	calls through the idle queue.
	
	* src/nautilus-view-frame.h: Moved all the fields into
	details. Renamed client_loaded to view_loaded. Renamed load_client
	to load_view. Eliminated load_client_sync. Renamed get_iid to
	get_view_iid. Eliminated get_is_underway. Added
	get_is_view_loaded.
	* src/nautilus-view-frame.c:
	(nautilus_view_frame_queue_incoming_call): Simple cover for
	putting an incoming CORBA call on the idle queue.
	(nautilus_view_frame_initialize_class): Change client_loaded
	signal name to view_loaded.
	(nautilus_view_frame_initialize): Allocate the idle queue.
	(stop_activation): New function that stops a load_view that is
	underway.
	(destroy_view): Use the "view" field to tell if a view was
	loaded. The old code used the "iid" field, but now we set that
	even before the load is completed.
	(nautilus_view_frame_destroy): Destroy the idle queue. Also put
	the view into "failed" state once it's destroyed so additional
	calls are harmless.
	(nautilus_view_frame_finalize): Check that we're in the failed
	state.
	(emit_zoom_parameters_changed): New function so we can share more
	code.
	(view_frame_activated): Emit the zoom_parameters_changed signal
	here since a new view should always should get this signal.
	(view_frame_underway): Make this do nothing in the failed case
	instead of complaining.
	(view_frame_loaded): Make this do nothing in the failed case
	instead of complaining.
	(view_frame_failed): Stop whatever's in progress when the view
	fails. Also, allow calling this on a view that's already failed.
	(check_if_view_is_gone): Consolidate the calls to
	deregister_dead_components so we don't need an explicit call here.
	(emit_zoom_parameters_changed_callback),
	(zoom_parameters_changed_callback),
	(emit_zoom_level_changed_callback), (zoom_level_changed_callback):
	Redo these so they queue onto the idle queue, since they are
	triggered by incoming CORBA calls that can happen at any time.
	(create_corba_objects): Factor out the part of the code that makes
	the CORBA objects. Make error handling more complete and keep
	around pointers to the Bonobo objects for various parts of the
	aggregate so we can connect the appropriate signal handlers.
	(attach_view): Change code so it no longer connects signals to the
	BonoboObjectClient, since the signals won't go out on that
	GtkObject. Connect to the exception signals for all objects in the
	aggregate (any failure means "view failed"). Also connect to the
	"destroy" signal for one object (doesn't matter which since the
	entire aggregate goes away at once) and to the zoom-related
	signals. Report errors with signals rather than returning a
	boolean.
	(activation_callback): Add code to handle failure case.
	(nautilus_view_frame_load_view): Renamed. Got rid of "sync."
	version.
	(nautilus_view_frame_stop): Stop OAF activation of the view if
	it's in progress.
	(nautilus_view_frame_selection_changed): Make it a quiet no-op to
	send a selection change notice if no view is loaded. This helps
	keep the code simple for sidebars. Later we may make the view
	frame responsible for sending the selection on once the view is
	loaded.
	(nautilus_view_frame_title_changed): Same change as for selection,
	same idea.
	(nautilus_view_frame_get_is_zoomable),
	(nautilus_view_frame_get_zoom_level),
	(nautilus_view_frame_set_zoom_level),

	(nautilus_view_frame_get_preferred_zoom_levels),
	(nautilus_view_frame_zoom_in), (nautilus_view_frame_zoom_out),
	(nautilus_view_frame_zoom_to_fit): Since a failed view has a
	zoomable_frame field set to NULL, got rid of all the explicit
	failure-case code for these functions.
	(nautilus_view_frame_get_view_iid): Renamed from get_iid. 
	(nautilus_view_frame_report_load_underway),
	(nautilus_view_frame_report_load_complete),
	(nautilus_view_frame_report_load_failed): Moved the "quiet"
	handling of failed views down into the underlying functions, so
	these no longer need explicit failure-case code.
	(nautilus_view_frame_set_label): It's OK to allow this even for a
	failed view.
	(nautilus_view_frame_map): Use a kept-around reference to the
	control frame instead of relying on query_local_interface.
	(nautilus_view_frame_get_is_view_loaded): Add this so callers can
	tell when a sidebar view is not yet loaded. Might not need this
	when we clean things up more, but it's no big deal either way.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: (update_title): No need to
	send the title change to the new content view -- it gets a title
	change once it comes up "for real".
	(set_displayed_location): Handle location of NULL here so we don't
	need to worry about it elsewhere.
	(check_bookmark_location_matches): Remove "uri" from name.
	(location_has_really_changed): Now that the state machine is gone,
	it's easy to see that this is never called with pending_ni equal
	to cancel_tag, so remove the code for that and add an assert.
	(set_view_location_and_selection): New name for what was called
	update_view.
	(set_sidebar_panels_location_and_selection): Cover since this loop
	occurs in two places.
	(update_for_new_location_and_selection): New name for what was
	called set_view_location_and_selection. Since it's now clear this
	can't be called with new_content_view equal to NULL, remove the
	code to handle that (fixes bug 2457).
	(load_content_view): Use async. view loading here. Get rid of
	"Avoid being fooled by extra done notifications from the last
	view. This is a HACK because the state machine SUCKS." by
	eliminating the "cv_progress_done" and "cv_progress_error" flags
	altogether. In the case where we reuse the same view, just call
	update_for_new_location_and_selection -- the old code set
	"view_activation_complete", but I eliminated that flag.
	(handle_view_failure): Remove the old view using
	nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget instead of having
	duplicate code here. Use a call to cancel_location_change instead
	of setting the "reset_to_idle" and "cv_progress_error" flags
	(both gone now).
	(free_location_change): No need to clean up "error_views" any
	more, because that field is gone.
	(end_location_change): New helper to stop the throbber from
	throbbing and then free the location change state.
	(cancel_location_change): Get rid of special case for NULL
	location now that set_displayed_location can handle it.
	(nautilus_window_end_location_change_callback): Remove
	"superstitiously" added call to update_state and call
	load_content_view_for_new_location directly.
	(nautilus_window_begin_location_change): Use a call to
	cancel_location_change to deal with the possibility that we may
	have a change already in progress.
	(nautilus_window_stop_loading): Use cancel_location_change to stop
	the loading.
	(nautilus_window_set_content_view): Remove calls to update_state
	-- there's no state to update any more.
	(nautilus_window_set_sidebar_panels): Do an async. load here and
	finish the setup in the view_loaded callback.
	(failed_callback): Do a handle_view_failed right here, now that we
	have no state machine to satisfy.
	(load_underway_callback): Change code to handle the two
	interesting cases separately without a state machine. When the new
	content view says "underway", it's time for
	location_has_really_changed. When an existing content view says
	"underway", we restart the throbber (fixes 1/2 of bug 2461).
	(load_complete_callback): Since view frames now ensure we get an
	underway call before a complete call, we can simplify the
	logic. If the main content view says "complete", it's time to stop
	the throbber (fixes other 1/2 of bug 2461).
	(view_loaded_callback): Renamed the client_loaded callback. Also
	made it update location and selection for sidebar panels when they
	are loaded. Also made it update the title for any view when it's
	loaded.

	* src/nautilus-window.h:
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_synch_view_as_menu):
	Handle case of NULL content view.
	(nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget): Destroy the view when
	it's going away instead of removing it from the parent. Also make
	this function handle the NULL case so we can use it to remove the
	old view, not just to add the new one.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bonobo-extensions.h: Whitespace
	tweak.

	* src/nautilus-sidebar.c:

	Fixed bug 5747, Nautilus freezes while mounting a device
	
	There were several issues here.  The first involved the use
	of popen to call the mount/umount command. If a mount/umount
	call causes a lengthy response, such as a hard drive spinning
	up, it would block the UI.  I changed the code to spawn a thread
	and schedule a gtk_idle to display feedback if any was generated.
	I also create a thread to call eject, instead of using a possibly
	blocking ioctl call. Another benefir of this is that we now have
	a more flexible eject mechanism. Zip drives and other removable
	media can no wbe ejected.  In the course of making these changes,
	another issue was found.  The dynamic creation of the removable
	volumes menus was causing a UI lock up.  I get around this by
	creating a list of removable volumes at volume monitor initialization
	instead of a dynamic list.  The downside of this is that any new
	entries added to the fstab while Nautilus is running will be overlooked.
	We will have to monitor the file in the future to work around this issue.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bonobo-extensions.c:
	(oaf_activation_callback), (nautilus_bonobo_activate_from_id),
	(nautilus_bonobo_activate_cancel): Fix interface of activation to
	be cleaner. Also handle case where callback is called right away.

	Add queuing to NautilusView so that all incoming CORBA calls are
	dispatched at idle time. This can fix some otherwise-difficult
	re-entrancy problems. The widget destroy call can still come in at
	any time though. Also this same fix may be needed for the
	NautilusViewFrame side.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view.h:
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view.c: (execute_queued_calls): Function
	to dequeue and execute calls.
	(dequeue_calls_at_idle): Cover to call it at idle time.

	(nautilus_view_frame_stop): Renamed this single function, which

	(update_state): Changed this to be a loop instead of returning a

	Fixed bug 2153 (deep count calculation in properties window
	could be faster)

	Fixed bug 5687 (Sidebar flickers and CPU thrashes during
	deep count calculation in properties window)

	Changed the deep count calculation to send a specialized
	signal when the in-progress count updates, instead of using
	"file_changed", since many parts of the UI react to file_changed
	by doing (in this case unnecessary) work. My stopwatch measurement
	on a large directory showed that the time to calculate 20000
	contained files went from 147 seconds to 8 seconds, and the CPU
	usage pegged around 15% (formerly 100%).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(deep_count_callback): Call nautilus_file_changed only when
	count is finished; call nautilus_file_updated_deep_count_in_progress

	Removed --tmp as you shouldn't set it anymore.
	Rename --noauth to --no-auth and --ssl_rename to --ssl-rename.

	Fix bug 5809 - Nautilus is slow to startup because of prefernces
	setup code.  The reason for the slowdown was the constant
	suggestion to gconf to sync.  Now, we sync only after setters that
	ara result of an operation in Nautilus.  All internal setters, such
	as defaults and visibilities happen with no sync in between each
	one, making things a lot faster.

	This was a long-standing race condition exposed by recent

	Finished bug 2146 (Properties window for desktop Trash
	should show Trash properties). The last two changes were
	to remove the "accessed" field for all directories, since
	it seems useless, and to fill in the "where" field with
	"on the desktop".

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:

	in the Trash case.

	Fixed bug 2147 (NautilusFile for trash needs non-empty values for
	more properties), bug 5652 (MIME type field appears but shouldn't
	in properties window for Trash), and bug 4620 (trash sidebar
	should show number of items).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_new_from_relative_uri): Create trash file subclass
	when appropriate.
	(nautilus_file_info_missing): Rename so it can be used in other
	source files.
	(nautilus_file_get_date): New method that returns numeric dates.
	(nautilus_file_get_date_as_string): Change to call
	nautilus_file_get_date to get the numeric date.
	(nautilus_file_get_file_type): Turn into a method.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-merged-directory.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-merged-directory.c:
	(merged_call_when_ready): Rolled in the old
	merged_callback_connect_directory function.
	(merged_contains_file): Moved down to a more appropriate part of
	the source file.
	(nautilus_merged_directory_get_real_directories): New public
	function for use by trash.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-trash-file.c:
	(trash_callback_hash), (trash_callback_equal),
	(trash_callback_destroy), (trash_callback_check_done),

	(trash_file_get_date), (remove_all_real_files),
	(nautilus_trash_file_initialize), (trash_destroy),
	(nautilus_trash_file_initialize_class):
	New code. First implementation of getting some attributes for the
	merged trash. Gets list of directories from the
	NautilusTrashDirectory object. The code in here is similar to the
	NautilusMergedDirectory class and at some point perhaps we can
	make the two share more.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-vfs-file.c:
	(vfs_file_get_file_type), (vfs_file_get_date),
	(nautilus_vfs_file_initialize_class): Implement the two new
	methods for the standard vfs case.
	
	Fixed various things that affect the properties window for the
	trash that showed up while I was testing the above work:
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	(nautilus_icon_factory_get_icon_name_for_regular_file),
	(nautilus_icon_factory_get_icon_name_for_file): Move trash special
	case out so it doesn't matter what type the trash seems to be. The
	old code relied on trash not being a directory.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(create_properties_window), (create_properties_window_callback),
	(cancel_create_properties_window_callback),
	(directory_view_destroyed_callback), (remove_pending_file): Rework
	code to fix problems where the timed wait or the signal handler
	wasn't properly cleaned up.

	Fixed remaining bit of bug 5631 (Tear-offs of right-click menus
	don't work.):
	
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-desktop-icon-view-ui.xml: Mark Disks
	right-click submenu so it won't get a tear-off item.

	Fixed bug 5650 (nautilus --quit fails to return to prompt
	sometimes):
	
	* src/nautilus-application.c: (nautilus_application_startup): Add
	special case so "nautilus --quit" doesn't hang waiting for a
	response from the (now quit) "server" instance of Nautilus.
	* src/nautilus-shell-interface.idl: Had to make the quit call no
	longer be "oneway" to get it to work right, otherwise the quit
	message could be lost when the sending application exited too
	fast.

	Fix bug 5675 (Nitpicks in new "could not be moved to new special
	location" dialog):

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-operations.c:
	(handle_transfer_overwrite): Updated message wording as Eli (and
	Vera) suggest.

	Other changes:
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-view-identifier.c:
	(get_lang_list): Fix comment and a small storage leak in the case
	where lang_with_locale is non-NULL but empty.
	
	* po/POTFILES.ignore: Obsolete file, no longer used.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(update_home_link_and_delete_copies): Update comment to help
	translators understand better.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(directory_load_callback): Added a new assertion that could help
	in future gnome-vfs debugging.
	
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view-component.idl: Removed long-ago-fixed
	FIXME comment.

	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: Tweak spacing.

	Used new gnome_vfs_expand_initial_tilde in two places

	Fix 4221 (Pressing Cancel button does not cancel)

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-operations.c:
	(transfer_dialog_clicked_callback), (handle_transfer_ok):
	Redo cancellation to use a flag in the Transfer state and
	return a request to cancel during the next callback instead
	of issuing a gnome_vfs_async_cancel and destroying the
	dialog. The latter approach would now work too with my
	latest change to gnome_vfs_xfer, this new way of cancelling
	is cleaner and causes all the item that actually do get
	copied to show up in their new locations.

	A lot of simplification.  The "Edit Settings..." menu item no
	longer changes it wording based on the user level.  We know allow
	it to edit settings on all user levels, since we have the ability
	to hide preferences at higher user levels.  No longer need to

	them twice in case another caller makes that call.
	(fm_directory_view_ignore_hidden_file_preferences): Turn on the

	(find_monitor): Use g_new0 so fields in the Monitor are not

	(nautilus_file_is_hidden_file), (nautilus_file_is_backup_file):
	Use the new functions and use the raw relative_uri -- no need to
	unescape to change to a file name since the "." and "~" characters
	are not encoded.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_initialize): Share more code with the
	filtering_changed_callback. Handle the desktop view better by
	never setting the "show hidden" and "show backup" flags (so they
	are both FALSE) and not setting up the callbacks.
	(fm_directory_view_destroy): Since we don't set up the callbacks
	for desktop windows, don't remove them for desktop windows.
	(queue_pending_files): Remove the desktop special case from

        More patches from John Fleck. A fixup for the QANDASET title showing
        up in the TOC.

        Also a fixup for bug #4409 (due to the switching of 'states' in the
        parser we sometimes would print out some extra HTML closing tags
        that shouldn't be there)

        Happy New Year.

	Fixed bug 5374 (No-longer-mounted removable media linger as

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(free_volume_black_list): Save code by using
	nautilus_g_list_free_deep.
	(create_mount_link): Save some g_strdup calls by using const char
	* for the icon_name.
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize): Simplify the code that creates

	(unlink_and_notify): Helper function that deletes a file and
	notifies the NautilusDirectory/File framework.
	(volume_unmounted_callback): Call unlink_and_notify to do the work.
	(create_link_callback): Pass NULL for default values when setting
	metadata, since we always want to set the metadata.
	(icon_view_create_nautilus_links): Avoid a storage leak by using
	const char * for the icon name.
	(update_link_and_delete_copies): New function shared for both the
	home and trash link cases. Simpler because it just lets the
	nautilus_link_xxx functions handle file vs. directory and . and
	.. and doesn't bother doing a stat itself. Also fixes leaks that
	were in the old versions as well as the questionable practice of
	using chdir instead of full paths. Also changes the logic to
	delete any links with the right type but wrong name, rather than
	trying to rename the first icon found of the right type.
	(update_home_link_and_delete_copies): Use the shared
	function. Also don't bother making unused home_link_path.
	(update_trash_link_and_delete_copies): Use the new shared
	function.
	(delete_all_mount_links): Turns out we can use the shared function
	for this case too just by passing in a name that will never match
	any existing link's name ("").

	(nautilus_icon_container_update_icon):
	fixed problem where images that are small in one dimension but large
	in the other were being scaled too large by the minimum size scaling.
	Fixed by pinning to both the minimum and maximum sizes.
	
	also, pinned icon view emblem sizes to MAXIMUM_EMBLEM_SIZE independent
	of scale factor, so they don't become enormous when the icons are
	large.

	Fixed bug 5296 (Hardware overview should be localized).
	Fixed bug 5299 (Spacing problems with sizes in bytes).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-metafile.c:
	(get_file_node): Used a local variable for the hash table to make
	the code more readable because the full expression is too long.
	Removed the half-baked attempt at using xmlNode objects to
	represent "changes" data, which no longer seems a likely
	direction.
	(nautilus_directory_metafile_destroy): Local variable for hash
	table.
	(nautilus_directory_get_file_metadata): Return NULL, not FALSE,
	since the function returns char *, not gboolean.
	(nautilus_directory_rename_file_metadata): Local variable for hash
	table. Also added a FIXME for a case that won't work.
	(apply_file_changes): Broke out so it can be used elsewhere.
	(apply_one_file_changes): This is now the version that has the
	hash table iterator function interface.
	(nautilus_directory_get_integer_file_metadata): Use sscanf instead
	of atoi so we can do error checking.
	(nautilus_directory_copy_file_metadata): Removed the old code that
	copied fixed keys and wrote new code that copies all the metadata.
	(nautilus_directory_remove_file_metadata): Local variable for hash
	table.

	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml: Added an explicit H offset of 0 for the
	zoom control. It was inheriting the default theme's offset of
	-2. This seems to indicate a design problem with the "fall back on
	default" approach for themes, but for now it's nice to have the
	zoom control looking right again.

	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c:
	(help_menu_about_nautilus_callback): Use the real copyright
	character, not "(C)".

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c
	(find_and_update_home_link), (place_home_directory): Mark the
	"darin's Home" string for localization. Needs improvement beyond
	this, because just tacking "'s Home" onto the login name is
	probably no good.

	* components/hardware/nautilus-hardware-view.c: (read_proc_info):
	Tweak code style a bit. Use g_string_free (FALSE) instead of
	g_strdup and g_string_free (TRUE).
	(get_CPU_description): Make this a little more localizable by
	adding a strdup format string instead of appending things. Added
	FIXMEs about additional problems.
	(get_RAM_description): Add a little reality checking on the value
	read from the file and make a little more localizable.
	(get_IDE_description): Change to use the gnome-vfs file size
	formatting functions in the right way. The old code had been
	changed to not use them at all, probably because the first cut at
	this code was using it wrong and ran into a 32-bit limit. Use
	g_string_free (FALSE) instead of g_strdup and g_string_free
	(TRUE).

	* po/POTFILES.in: Marked nautilus-hardware-view.c as needing

	(sect_informaltable_start_element): Fixed a runaway string
	literal.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c: Moved the
	constants to the top of the file and put the compile-time switches
	at the top of the constants section.
	
	* NEWS: Removed out of date news.

2000-12-23  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        So, I thought I was fixing this bug in the Eazel bugtracker. I hack
        away, and get gzipped man files showing up in the Help sidebar. Turns
        out, that the bug I /should/ have been working on was some info-files
        now showing up in the Help sidebar.

        Oh well, at least we now get gzipp'd man files showing up in the
        sidebar (which is most man files nowadays).

        So I continuied hacking and fixd bug #4414 (info files in Debian do
        not show up in Help sidebar)

        * components/help/hyperbola-filefmt.c:
        (extract_secnum_from_filename),
        (name_without_suffix): New functions

        (fmt_man_populate_tree_from_subdir):
        gnome-man2html2 actually supports gzip'd files. So this needed some
        major work to get it to support them gzip'd files.

        (fmt_info_populate_tree):
        Also populate tree from the /usr/share/info subdir. I think this helps
        destroy bug #4414

	command line. Fixes bug #5135

	* src/nautilus-shell.c (open_window): new arg `geometry'. When
	non-null, use nautilus_gtk_window_set_initial_geometry_from_string
	to affect the geometry of the unmapped window

	(corba_open_default_window, corba_open_windows): new arg,
	`geometry', passed to open_window () if a non-null string

	* src/nautilus-shell-interface.idl (open_windows,
	open_default_window): added `geometry' parameter. Pass a
	zero-length string to show no specified geometry

	* src/nautilus-main.c (main): new option `--geometry=GEOMETRY'.
	Pass the value to nautilus_application_startup (). This option
	is only allowed when no more than one URI is given on the
	command line (to prevent multiple windows appearing on top of
	one another)

	* src/nautilus-application.c, src/nautilus-application.h
	(nautilus_application_startup): added parameter `geometry', a
	string describing the geometry to give any created windows

	* src/nautilus-first-time-druid.c (druid_finished): pass null
	geometry parameter to nautilus_application_startup ()

	* libnautilus/nautilus-gdk-extensions.c,
	libnautilus/nautilus-gdk-extensions.h
	(NautilusGdkGeometryFlags, nautilus_gdk_parse_geometry): a
	wrapper for XParseGeometry () and associated bit definitions.
	Required since gnome_parse_geometry () offers no reliable way
	of detecting which of the geometry components were parsed
	successfully

	* libnautilus/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c,
	libnautilus/nautilus-gtk-extensions.h
	(nautilus_gtk_window_set_initial_geometry): takes an extra
	parameter, a NautilusGdkGeometryFlags value specifying which of
	the geometry parameters are valid

	(nautilus_gtk_window_set_initial_geometry_from_string): changed
	to allow the geometry string to specify one or both of position
	and dimensions. Also doesn't use g_return_if_fail to test for
	validity of input string (since it may come from the user),
	instead just use the parseable parts of the geometry string

	The problem was that the activate signal and the focus-out signal

	(name_field_restore_original_name): Select text of original name
	after restoring it into text field.

	(name_field_done_editing): Remember pending name in case window
	and name field get destroyed before callback. Ref window so it
	won't be finalized before callback.
	(rename_callback): Restore original name when rename fails, use
	stored pending name for window, unref window.

	as callback data so it can be passed to done_editing.
	(create_basic_page): Remember name field in window details struct

        Added a patch contributes by Mark Murnane <Mark.Murnane@ireland.sun.com>
        that integrates experimental ScrollKeeper support for Hyperbola (the
        Help Sidebar). This is disabled by default. You should #define
        ENABLE_SCROLLKEEPER_SUPPORT to be able to use it.

	Fixed bug 5040 (only one dead view name gets saved for a window)

	This was a tangled mess of issues, including: (1) the dialog
	code was incorrectly guessing "sidebar panel" when a content
	view failed in some cases (fixed); (2) view frame lifetime
	issues found while working on (1) (fixed); (3) the state machine
	can fail if asked to load the same location twice very quickly
	(written up as bug 5197); (4) the Help sidebar panel asks to

	reviewed by: John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 2807 (support metadata removal for cases where we
	move/delete files) by implementing metadata removal.

	Fix bug 2199 (Saved icon positions ruin desktop layout features)
	by testing and fixing other bugs now that metadata removal is
	implemented.

	Fix bug 5164 (exception trying to drag file) by fixing a few
	placeholders in XML files that were still transparent and should
	not be.

	Fix bug where we don't reveal the New Folder icon (reintroduced by
	my changes yesterday) by computing the icon position in a way that
	works even before the canvas item is updated.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-metafile.c:
	(get_file_node): Small change (not used for now) that might
	help unify the "before metafile is read" case with the code
	after the metafile is read.
	(nautilus_directory_rename_file_metadata): Remove the old
	file metadata before renaming the new data. Also change code
	to avoid looking up things in the hash table twice.
	(nautilus_directory_copy_file_metadata): Updated and added
	FIXME comments.
	(nautilus_directory_remove_file_metadata): Add code to
	remove metadata, similar to the existing rename code.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(nautilus_directory_schedule_metadata_copy),
	(nautilus_directory_schedule_metadata_move),
	(nautilus_directory_schedule_metadata_remove): Fix code that was
	using file names instead of relative URIs (essentially escaped
	file names). This code was missed when we made the
	switchover. Without this, changes to files with spaces in their
	names didn't update metadata properly.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-operations.c:
	(build_error_string): Added blank line between the intro sentence
	and the rest of the error message.
	(handle_xfer_overwrite): Added blank line between the intro
	sentence and the rest of the error message.
	(sync_xfer_callback): Fix metadata code to remove the metadata
	when creating a new file, just as it copies metadata when copying
	a file. This change helps the New Folder case, but requires a fix
	in gnome-vfs to set the top level boolean for the New Folder case.
	(handle_new_folder_vfs_error): Added blank line between the intro
	sentence and the rest of the error message.
	(nautilus_self_check_file_operations): Changed the self-check to
	use the standard way of testing functions that return text instead
	of rolling its own.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gnome-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gnome-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_gnome_canvas_item_get_canvas_bounds): Added a function
	that's like nautilus_gnome_canvas_item_get_current_canvas_bounds
	but is accurate even before the icon is updated.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c: (reveal_icon):
	Use nautilus_gnome_canvas_item_get_canvas_bounds instead of
	nautilus_gnome_canvas_item_get_current_canvas_bounds. Fixes the
	bug I reintroduced where New Folder icons would not be revealed.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-xml-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-xml-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_xml_remove_node): Add a remove-node function. This is
	needed because gnome-xml doesn't have xmlRemoveNode
	implemented. This implementation is not quite complete, but
	probably good enough for our purposes. A complete implementation
	might have to have some handling for removing the root node and
	perhaps some stuff to remove unused namespaces. Maybe this can be
	rolled into gnome-xml.
	
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml:
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml:
	Added some more delimit="none" entries to make it so that the
	actual placeholder definitions are not "transparent".
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-glib-extensions.c
	(nautilus_self_check_glib_extensions): Marked some strings that
	are part of a test translatable since the result might be
	different in some locales. Translating the strings to the right
	result makes "make check" work properly in that locale.

	Changed the way that the view stects availability of sound

	Improve New Window performance when the tree view is enabled, to
	partially address bug 4922 (Opening new windows is really slow
	when the tree view is enabled). This affects only the New Window
	case, not the initial window. Here's some timings before and after
	on my laptop with a bunch of stuff expanded (times in seconds):

	                          First window    New window
	Tree View Off                  8              5
	w/ Tree Before My Change      16              37
	w/ Tree After My Change       16	      20

	I made this change by altering tree view semantics slightly. The
	tree view used to do a force reload any time it expanded a
	directory. Now it does a normal load the first time any given
	directory is expanded (as at startup, or when you first expand the
	node), but a force reload on subsequent collapse and
	expansion. This is more in line with the way the rest of Nautilus
	works.
	
	* components/tree/nautilus-tree-expansion-state.h,
	components/tree/nautilus-tree-expansion-state.c:
	(nautilus_tree_expansion_state_was_ever_expanded): New function to
	see if a node was ever expanded. Being initially expanded does not
	count; only being expanded through an API call to
	`nautilus_tree_expansion_state_expand_node' does.
	(nautilus_tree_expansion_state_load_foreach_callback,
	nautilus_tree_expansion_state_initialize,
	nautilus_tree_expansion_state_destroy,
	nautilus_tree_expansion_state_expand_node_internal,
	nautilus_tree_expansion_state_expand_node): Adjusted to track
	"was_ever_expanded" property right.

	function.
	(nautilus_tree_model_node_begin_monitoring,

	not a force reload.
	(expand_uri_sequence_and_select_end): Simplify logic a bit.

	Fix bug 4919 (Tree view crashes when you expand and collapse the
	root node). I did this by changing the design of file attribute
	forgetting, which I implemented recently - now when you forget an
	attribute, it is merely marked out of date, not thrown away; the
	old value is still available until the fresh value is actually
	loaded. This fixes other potential UI problems with the old
	approach but I am not sure if bugs were filed for those.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: Added new

	Terminology change -- the window & menu item formerly known
	as "Customization" are now known as "Backgrounds and Emblems";
	the swatches of image formerly known as "backgrounds" are
	now known as "patterns".

	After 1.0 if this window acquires more varied content we will
	have to redo the menu item & window label, though we will
	continue to distinguish between "backgrounds" and "patterns", 
	since "backgrounds" encompasses colors as well as images.

	Note that this change will only appear in full (and your
	"Backgrounds and Emblems" window work in full) after you've

	Unfortunately, since rpmview now also has a eazelpackagesystem

	would have a read-only version of all the db files, thereby
	failing in install because trilobite-eazel-install-service spawned
	a rpm that could not get exclusive lock. To fix this, I now have
	the db closed at all times, but open/close it everytime I do
	something. Unfortunately for the queryloops in
	eazel-install-logic, this means opening/closing on every
	query. Optionally, I should consider exposing
	eazel_package_system_open/close_dbs, so the caller can do it. But
	that makes the api a bit more cumbersome.

	* nautilus.spec.in:
	added nautilus-text-view files to spec file
	
	* src/nautilus-window-toolbars.c: (theme_changed_callback):
	fixed bug 4982, throbber mispositioned when theme changes,
	by toggling the toolbar's visibility when the theme changes
	
2000-12-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	reviewed by: Darin Adler <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2230 (Search can find hidden files, which the user
	can't otherwise see)

	Unfortunately this fix leaves behind a related but harder-
	to-fix bug, bug 5029. I'll fix that separately.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_should_show_file): New function, intended
	for subclasses, returns whether a single file should be
	displayed or not, based on user's filter preferences.

	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c: 
	(real_add_file): Use should_show_file to filter out files
	that don't match preferences. The normal directory-view
	mechanism doesn't work in this case due to the way
	the search view uses "fake" uris to pass around the
	search results.

2000-12-07  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>
	Hopefully will improve performance for
	menu merging in a case where it is poor.

	involve some design changes in the way the
	clipboard works, though.

	reviewed by: John Sullivan <sullivan@eazel.com>
	(the additional bonobo freezes and thaws)

	* libnautilus/nautilus-clipboard.c:
	(merge_in_clipboard_menu_items), (merge_out_clipboard_menu_items):
	Add freezes and thaws in hopes of improving performance here
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: (nautilus_window_initialize_menus):
	Ditto

	* components/tree/nautilus-tree-view-dnd.c:

	fixed.

2000-12-07  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Enabled the jump to next feature. This should be the last missing

	reviewed by: Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-search-uri.c: (parse_uri): Removed
	the *_suffix code. The change log said this would require data structure
	chagnges, but it didn't. Just deleting the code.
	(nautilus_self_check_search_uri): Fix test cases that were causing
	"make check" and Tinderbox to fail, added FIXMES.

2000-12-07  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@eazel.com>

	* nautilus.spec.in: OK this time I really will remove nautilus-mpg123

2000-12-07  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Changes to fix bugs 2341, to match the sidebar
	to Arlo's design for search results, and 3488
	that the human readable description of search
	results ends in a period.

	reviewed by: Maciej Stachowiak <mjs@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-search-uri.c:
	(get_nth_criterion_suffix):
	Remove "." from this function.  Eventually,
	this function should be deprecated, but it will
	require some data structure changes, so I left a
	FIXME and an associated bug 5019.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c: (load_location_callback):
	Set the search results title to be "Search Results" instead of
	the human readable description
	* src/nautilus-sidebar-title.c: (file_is_search),
	(update_more_info):
	Special case search uri's for the "more_info" part
	of the sidebar to be in accordance with Arlo's design.
	This is an annoying way of doing things, but until
	a better framework is in place, John Sullivan and 
	I agreed this was ok to do for now.

2000-12-07  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4679, Double clicking on an MP3 in music view should play it

	* components/music/nautilus-music-view.c: (selection_callback):

	reviewed by: Darin Adler <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3926 (summary view uses non-standard anti-aliased
	text in error dialogs)

	Fixed unreported bug where closing the summary view error
	dialog with close box would leave user at gray screen.

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c:
	(get_window_from_summary_view): Split this out from set_dialog_parent
	so I could also use it in a different context.
	(set_dialog_parent): Now calls get_window_from_summary_view.
	(generate_error_dialog): Now just calls nautilus_error_dialog instead
	of doing a bunch of custom code to set up an anti-aliased text error
	dialog. After we get the anti-aliased text preference to work on
	NautilusLabel, we can consider changing nautilus_error_dialog and
	friends to use it everywhere, but it doesn't make sense for error 
	dialogs	only in this one place to look different from all others.
	Also, connected error_dialog_cancel_cb to the "destroy" signal
	instead of just to the OK button, so that closing the dialog with
	the close box will have the same effect as the OK button.

	* components/text/nautilus-text-view.c:
	(nautilus_text_view_initialize), (add_one_service),
	(update_service_menu_items), (merge_bonobo_menu_items):
	fixed problem with "command/verb separation", and added support
	for the clipboard to the text view.

	* nautilus-clean.sh:
	added nautilus-text-view to nautilus-clean.sh
	
	* data/emblems/Makefile.am:
	* data/emblems/danger.png:

	* icons/i-executable-aa.png:	
	fixed bug 4691, executable icon looks like KDE icon, by using
	a new icon from Susan
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(icon_container_preview_callback):
	fixed bug 4926, Nautilus tries to preview realaudio files but
	can't, by special casing the realaudio mime type.  Also, cleaned
	things up a little by removing redundant is_local call.
	
2000-12-07  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 954, Plays two MP3s at once instead of one at a time

	This was caused by playback not being stopped when a new uri

	permissions), bug 4965 (Dragging multiple items to location bar
	crashes Nautilus), and bug 4995 (Rename a file to bad name ->
	error cites wrong filename).

	Fixed a bug jsh spotted where we were doing the mod. time checks
	wrong in the icon factory for thumbnails.

	Did some wording fixes after menthos pointed out some problems.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c:
	(get_cache_time): Split out this function to get the mtime of a
	file so we can check when it changed.
	(load_specific_icon): Get the time when loading an icon.
	(scale_icon): Copy the time when making a scaled icon from an
	existing icon.
	(remove_icons_if_file_changed): New renamed function uses
	get_cache_time to check if the icon needs recomputing because of a
	change in the underlying file.
	(get_icon_from_cache): Call the new remove_icons_if_file_changed.
	(load_icon_with_embedded_text): Copy the time when making an icon
	with text from an existing icon.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-attributes.h: Added
	ATTRIBUTE_CAPABILITIES (and sorted in alphabetical order).

	made it public, and added ATTRIBUTE_CAPABILITIES as another
	way to ask for the file info.
	(cancel_loading_attributes),
	(nautilus_directory_cancel_loading_file_attributes): Set up a
	request and use it to decide what to cancel.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: Moved the
	request structure and call into here so it can be used by
	NautilusFile and NautilusDirectory both.

	(nautilus_file_forget_attributes_internal): Set up a request and
	use it to decide what to forget.

	(file_changed_callback): Helper to schedule a menu update when

	(load_directory): Add monitoring of the directory's "capabilities"

	Addressed bug 4208 (Opening new window is slow)

	Pavel identified the 2nd biggest performance bottleneck in
	opening a new window (1st being tree view) as the code that
	sets up the bookmark menus. I found some good speedups; time
	to profile again.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c:
	(bookmark_file_changed_callback): nautilus_uris_match returns
	a gboolean, not a strcmp-style int. Doh! Sense of test was
	reversed, causing many unnecessary rebuild-bookmarks-menus.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: 
	(append_static_bookmarks), (refresh_bookmarks_menu): Wrapped
	some Bonobo-ui-manipulating code with freeze/thaw; this speeds

	to avoid possibly dereferencing a NULL view_node pointer. This can

	(finish_adding_new_icons): Remove unnecessary check for NULL.
	(nautilus_icon_container_add): Use the new schedule_redo_layout.
	(nautilus_icon_container_remove): Use schedule_redo_layout instead
	of redoing the layout right away, since this can be called for
	many icons at a time and we want to bunch up the layout work.
	(nautilus_icon_container_request_update): Schedule a redo_layout
	any time an icon changes. We could get fancy and detect changes
	that are substantive if this does too much extra layout work.

	(nautilus_window_end_location_change_callback):

	displaying RPM files in general, whereas in fact it has a
	viewer that can display RPM files, but only if local. This

	Fixed bug 4899 (Bookmark for nonexistent file can cause
	infinite loop at startup)

	Changed NautilusBookmark's internal logic so that it doesn't
	keep around a file object for known non-existent URIs. The
	trick is to get it to notice when the URI is no longer non-existent
	and get a fresh file object then. This is done imperfectly, but
	the new symptom is very minor and deferrable (wrote it up as bug 4906).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bookmark.c:
	(nautilus_bookmark_connect_file): Don't get a new NautilusFile
	object if we know the URI doesn't exist; instead just set the
	missing-bookmark icon. Also made it safe to call this routine
	when there's already a file object in hand (just bails out early).
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_icon), (nautilus_bookmark_get_uri): 
	Call nautilus_bookmark_connect_file so that it will connect to a 
	now-existing file if possible (and thus	get the right icon).
	Since callers that try to activate the bookmark will call get_uri,
	one way to kick a reincarnated bookmark's icon into appearing is
	to select it in a menu.
	(nautilus_bookmark_get_pixbuf): Call nautilus_bookmark_get_icon to
	benefit from its connect_file logic.


	Fixed bug 3847 (Icon in properties window flashes while 
	folder count increments)

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-image.c:
	(nautilus_image_set_pixbuf): Don't call gtk_widget_queue_resize if
	the pixbuf hasn't changed.


	Fixed bug 1454 (Properties dialog needs mucho tweaking)

	Mostly this was changes to match Arlo's design that he gave me

	(attach_group_menu), (attach_owner_menu): Use attach_option_menu.
	(attach_separator): New helper function to install a separator
	across both columns of a properties window table.
	(create_basic_page): Use gtk_alignment to make the icon right-aligned;
	make the blank row above date rows be standard height.
	(create_emblems_page): Changed layout so name appears below emblem
	rather than to its right; this matches Customize window and allows
	the Properties window to be a smaller width, which looks much better

	Fixed bugs 4385 (Nautilus doesn't gracefully handle deleting
	in-use image file), 3240 (reloading a directory doesn't update
	directory counts of the entries) and 4683 (embedded text on icon
	isn't updated when text changes) by implementing forgetting of
	file attributes and using it when appropriate.

	Also fixed various other bugs caught by testing of these fixes or
	reading the code.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: 
	(nautilus_file_forget_attributes): New function that makes the
	file forget the specified attributes, including cancelling
	possible in-progress I/O for them, and kicking off new I/O if
	anyone is monitoring any of the attributes or has a pending
	call_when_ready.
	(nautilus_file_forget_attributes_internal): Forget all attributes
	of this file, *not* including cancelling in-progress I/O, or
	kicking off new I/O. This is for the benefit of NautilusDirectory
	being able to forget the attributes of all files it is monitoring
	at one go.
	(nautilus_file_forget_all_attributes): Forget all attributes of
	this file, including cancelling in-progress I/O, and kicking off
	new I/O.
	(forget_directory_count, forget_deep_counts, forget_mime_list,
	forget_top_left_text, forget_file_info, forget_activation_uri):
	Helper functions to forget individual attributes.
	(nautilus_file_forget_activation_uri): Removed as obsolete.
	(destroy): use `nautilus_g_list_free_deep' to free the mime list.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-notify.h: Remove
	prototype for `nautilus_file_forget_activation_uri'.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: Prototype
	`nautilus_file_forget_attributes_internal'.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h:
	`nautilus_file_forget_attributes' and
	`nautilus_file_forget_all_attributes'.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-link.c
	(nautilus_link_local_set_link_uri): Use
	`nautilus_file_forget_attributes', not
	`nautilus_file_forget_activation_uri' to ensure reload of the
	activation URI.
	(forget_file_activation_uri): Helper function for the above.
		
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c
	(nautilus_directory_cancel_loading_file_attributes): Function to
	cancel in-progress I/O for a given set of attributes but only if
	it is in progress for the specified file. This function is used to
	implement part of `nautilus_file_forget_attributes'.
	(cancel_directory_count_for_file, cancel_deep_counts_for_file,
	cancel_mime_list_for_file, cancel_top_left_text_for_file,
	cancel_file_info_for_file, cancel_activation_uri_for_file): Helper
	functions for the above.
	(nautilus_directory_force_reload): Add a `file_attributes'
	argument and make sure to forget the specified
	attributes. Forgetting the attributes fixes bugs 3240 and 4683.
	(nautilus_directory_forget_file_attributes): Function to forget
	the specified attributes for all files. It makes sure to only
	cancel and kick off new I/O once.
	(cancel_loading_attributes): helper function for the above that
	cancels in-progress loads for the specified attributes, regardless
	of for what file.
	(request_is_satisfied): The request is not satisfied if the
	request calls for top left text and the file lacks it.	
	(top_left_read_callback): Set 1got_top_left_text' field of the
	NautilusFile to TRUE. This problem was masked by the problem with
	`request_is_satisfied' fixed above.
	(set_up_request_by_file_attributes): Make sure to request the
	file_info as well if top left text is requested, since
	applicability of top left text depends on the mime type.
	(get_info_callback): Mark the file gone if we get
	GNOME_VFS_ERROR_NOT_FOUND; we can only get this error for files
	gnome-vfs should know about but that do not exist. This is needed
	to detect files that are removed on a reload.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: Update
	prototype for `nautilus_directory_force_reload'; Prototype
	`nautilus_directory_cancel_loading_file_attributes'

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-vfs-directory.c
	(vfs_file_monitor_add): Pass the file attributes to
	`nautilus_directory_force_reload' since it now wants them.

	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c
	(viewed_file_changed_callback): Cancel location change before
	closing the window, since detecting the file is gone is now likely
	to happen in the middle of an in-progress reload, and we get
	crashes if this is not done.	
	(nautilus_window_begin_location_change): If we're doing a reload,
	forget all file attributes of the NautilusFile for the currently
	viewed location. This is to make sure we detect if the file is
	gone, and also update the sidebar panel icon and other info
	appropriately. This fixes bug 4385.

	not a "connect_object" callback, and simplified the logic.
	(cancel_viewed_file_changed_callback): Added a function to cancel
	the callback, which is needed both when the window is destroyed
	and when the viewed file changes.
	(update_for_new_location): Cancel the old callback before setting
	up the new one so we don't leave behind callbacks for old locations.
	Also use the new nautilus_window_set_viewed_file function so the
	callbacks set up in nautilus-window.c can be managed properly.
	(free_location_change): Moved part of
	nautilus_window_free_load_info in here. This function frees all
	the stuff that's used in the location change process; shared by
	destroy and "cancel" code. Also fixed a bug where it wouldn't free
	the "error_views".
	(cancel_location_change): Moved the rest of
	nautilus_window_free_load_info in here and made this use the new
	function.
	(disconnect_view): Made this private now that the code to
	disconnect the views is inside this file.
	(disconnect_view_callback),
	(nautilus_window_manage_views_destroy): Moved the code to clean up
	from nautilus-window.c in here. Added cleanup for the location
	change fields and for the viewd_file_changed callback.
	
	* src/nautilus-window.c: 
	(nautilus_window_destroy): Call a new function to do the
	nautilus-window-manage-views.c part of the destroy and moved some
	code in there. Cancel the view-as callback too.
	(create_view_as_menu_item),
	(replace_special_current_view_in_view_as_menu),
	(nautilus_window_synch_view_as_menu): Renamed. The words "view as
	menu" are clearer than "content view menu".
	(chose_component_callback): Got rid of code that tries to handle
	bad values for callback data. The callback must be cancelled,
	because you can't call NAUTILUS_IS_WINDOW on a freed window and
	expect it to behave predictably.
	(cancel_chose_component_callback): Function to cancel the callback,
	called at both destroy time and before adding a new one.
	(view_menu_choose_view_callback): Cancel the old callback before
	adding a new one.
	(view_menu_vfs_method_callback): Simplify logic a bit.
	(load_view_as_menu_callback): Renamed.
	(cancel_view_as_callback): Function to cancel the callback, called
	at both destroy time and before adding a new one.
	(nautilus_window_load_view_as_menu): Cancel the old callback before
	adding a new one. Also renamed.
	(nautilus_window_set_viewed_file): A new function that cancels the
	callbacks on the file object before switching to a new one.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.c:
	(nautilus_cancel_choose_component_for_file): Implemented missing
	cancel function, needed by new window code.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-private.h:

	Fixed bug 4257 (right click on background in icon or list
	view doesn't leave context menus up)

	This was a problem with nautilus_pop_up_context_menu. It
	wasn't passing the event time, which caused GTK to think
	that the button-release was for a later button press, and
	consequently to close the context menu. It appears that the
	root cause may be a gtk menu handling bug, but this checkin
	fixes the problem as far as Nautilus is concerned.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_pop_up_context_menu): Now takes event as a
	parameter, and passes event->time through to gtk_menu_popup.
	Passes 0 for button if event is a button release, to work with
	subtle logic in gtk popup menu-handling.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c:
	Add event parameters to context-click signal handlers.
	(nautilus_icon_container_initialize_class): Change signal
	marshal and signature.
	(context_menu_parameters_new), (context_menu_parameters_free):
	New helper functions to manage callback data when delaying

	(button_press_event), (button_release_event),
	(show_context_menu_callback): Pass event when emitting signal.
	(handle_icon_button_press): Pass event as well as container
	to idle callback.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-list.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-list.c:

	I made a few modifications, including some resizing requests,
	when the chosen size is not the right one for the actual 
	space available.  Sizing wrapping boxes is a tricky problem
	with gtk, because they have nonstandard sizing requests
	(they can request x or y or z) and my solution is probably
	not optimal, since some of the sizing adjustments are visible
	on screen.  However, a better fix is a lot more time consuming,

	Fixes for bugs 690 and 733, to make the clipboard
	work for file editing in place, and make sensitivity
	work. Paste doesn't work correctly still, and a bug
	is filed for this issue.  

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-entry.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-entry.c:
	(nautilus_entry_initialize_class), (nautilus_entry_key_press),

	(nautilus_entry_set_selection), (nautilus_entry_insert_text),
	(nautilus_entry_delete_text):
	Added a new signal to nautilus entry, called "selection_changed"

	correctly.

	(nautilus_icon_container_initialize_class),

	(nautilus_icon_text_item_get_renaming_editable):

	Sad hacks that I had to add on top of this already scary file so
	that the editable, which is in its own offscreen window somewhere,
	communicates to the clipboard what is actually going on when text
	is entered and selections are changed.  This includes adding a
	new signal when text is changed, to make sure the entry knows about
	it, firing an initial grab focus for the widget so that the widget
	turns on, passing on more of the events of the canvas
	widget, including motion notifies and focus events, and 
	keeping a persistent copy of the last renaming entry in the icon
	container so that pastes for that widget will still work.

	use the "selection_changed" signal (NautilusEntries) 
	say "TRUE" here, otherwise selection doesn't work quite 
	right, and FALSE is used instead.

	Final changes to kill off the legendary bug 3579
	(Convert directory view context menus to use Bonobo)

	* libnautilus/nautilus-bonobo-ui.h:
	#define for zoom items placeholder in popup. Remove
	#defines for popup-specific zooming commands, since now
	we don't need distinct popup-specific ones.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bonobo-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-bonobo-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_bonobo_set_label_for_menu_item_and_command):
	Moved this here and commented; it had been a private 
	function in fm-directory-view.c.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(real_merge_menus): Just hide the placeholder for the zoom items,
	which is now sufficient due to a Bonobo fix Darin made.
	(real_update_menus): Update for API name change.
	(set_label_for_menu_and_command): Moved this to another file
	and renamed it.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	(fm_icon_view_update_menus): Update the dynamic menu items
	in-line here, as was done with fm-directory-view.c in an earlier
	checkin.
	(compute_menu_item_info), (update_one_menu_item): Removed these
	obsolete functions.
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml: Eliminated special pop-up versions of
	zoom commands. They existed only to allow hiding without affecting
	the menu-bar versions, but now that placeholders can be hidden
	these aren't necessary.
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: (nautilus_window_initialize_menus):

	(Patch for check-FIXME.pl; later I added
	additional check for "This is not a fixme bug")
	
	* check-FIXME.pl:
	Add the functionality that it also checks for bugs marked
	with "fixme" in the bugzilla database for a product, and
	notifies you if the bug has no fixme comment in the source.
	This is not a perfect operation, so you can explicitly
	include the comment "This is not a fixme bug" and the 
	script will ignore it.

	Reimplemented code that updates menu items' labels and
	sensitivity in a much more straightforward way, made
	possible by the elimination of gtk context menus.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(reset_bonobo_open_with_menu): set sensitivity in here
	instead of in a separate call. Also set sensitivity of
	"Open With" title in context menu, which was previously
	always sensitive. However, it is still always sensitive
	due to a Bonobo bug.
	(set_label_for_menu_and_command): Helper function that
	handles stripping the underscore for the command's label.
	(real_update_menus): Now all the dynamic menu items are
	updated in here, which removes a lot of string compares,
	unnecessary label-setting, and other extra code.

	(compute_menu_item_info), (update_one_menu_item),
	(reset_bonobo_trash_delete_menu): Removed functions;

	Fixed bug 4717, Nautilus draw desktop icons overlapping.

	The problem was caused by the icon container responding to
	an idle function that lays out icons that had been
	newly added.  This is a problem if the callback is called
	from an idle after the icon container has been created, but
	before a size has been allocated. A newly intialized GtkWidget
	has a default allocation of 0, 0, 1, 1 which is too small
	for the layout algorithm to work properly.  A flag was added
	that is set to TRUE when the size_allocate function is called.

	little as possible until the log handler is set up.  Add a flag to
	the installer service that indicates if the installer ran out of
	disk space.  Then, you know, actually check the return codes of
	fwrite/fclose to see if they failed.
	
	* nautilus-installer/src/Makefile:

	More crap.

	(create_install_page), (create_window), (get_detailed_errors),
	(download_failed), (eazel_install_preflight), (install_done),
	(eazel_installer_initialize):

	Re-shuffle some of the initialization to move as much as possible
	after the fetching of the text strings.  It isn't possible to
	cover 100% of the cases this way, so load the default text strings
	first, so we'll have text to display in early errors.  Fix a
	dyslexic typo that would occasionally cause an assertion to fail.
	Notice the new disk-full flag and give an appropriate error
	message.

	* nautilus-installer/src/main.c: (check_disk_space), (main):

	Check for disk space before starting, and refuse to even start
	unless there's N space in /tmp and M space in /.  For now, N = M =
	75 MB.

	* nautilus-installer/src/prescript:

	Apply kisza's patch (4729) to fix xhost parameters.

2000-11-14  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Buddy: john harper.

2000-11-14  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/gdb3html.c:
        (init_entities),
        (gdb3html_internalSubset):
        New function and a workaround for the entity bug. Should now support
        &mdash;/&hellip;/&percent; - Fixes bug #2438.

        * components/help/help-method.c:
        (transform_file), (old_help_file),
        (find_help_file):
        Realized that that the gnome_help_file_path function checks for the
        existance of the file using g_file_exists. This spoiled things for the
        way we were trying to detect locale. Fixed it (Bug #4618).

        There is still a bug in this which I will tackle later. This'll do for
        now.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(display_selection_info_idle_callback),
	(update_menus_idle_callback), (display_pending_idle_callback): Add

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-link-set.c:
	(nautilus_link_set_install), (nautilus_link_set_is_installed),
	(nautilus_link_set_remove): Fix storage leaks, also use
	nautilus_xml_get_property_translated to get the property for the
	"name" property so it can be translated if desired.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-xml-extensions.h:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-xml-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_xml_get_property_translated): Add a version of
	xmlGetProp that looks for an untranslated version of the property
	and runs it through gettext if there is not a pre-translated
	version present.  For strings downloaded from the service, for
	example, we'll probably use a pre-translated string, but for
	things in the Nautilus source tree we can use an untranslated
	string.
	
	* src/nautilus-bookmark-parsing.c:
	(nautilus_bookmark_new_from_node): Use
	nautilus_xml_get_property_translated to get the bookmark name so
	that static bookmarks can have names translated with gettext. New

	use either kind of name. And user-created bookmarks are not run
	through the gettext mechanism.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: (create_menu_item_from_node): Use
	nautilus_xml_get_property_translated to get the folder names
	translated just as the bookmarks themselves.

	FIXME. The link set names should come from inside the XML, not
	from the file names.

	(add_reset_property): Make hard-wired font size with FIXME.
	(make_properties_from_xml_node): Fix storage leaks and get the
	name of the color using nautilus_xml_get_property_translated so
	the names can be translated.
	(set_up_category_width): Fix storage leaks
	(nautilus_property_browser_update_contents): Fix storage leaks and
	get the display name and description with
	nautilus_xml_get_property_translated so they can be translated.

	* check-THANKS.pl: Got rid of extra blank line at end.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-customization-data.c:
	(format_name_for_display): Add FIXME to bad-for-localization
	function that turns "_" into " " and capitalizes the first letter
	after each " ".

	More work towards using Bonobo for context menus. Also, found
	and fixed bug where "Open With" items weren't working from
	the File menu (though they were from the context menu).

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(add_open_with_program_menu_item): Determine verb name from item
	path, not item label. This was broken before, causing "Open With"
	items in the File menu not to work. Not sure why this ever worked,
	but I didn't spend too much time investigating its change history.
	(add_open_with_app_bonobo_menu_item), 
	(add_open_with_viewer_bonobo_menu_item): Removed these functions;
	they were adding an extra layer that ended up hurting rather than
	helping.
	(add_application_to_bonobo_menu),
	(add_component_to_bonobo_menu): consolidated with the removed
	functions; add item to context menu as well as normal menu.
	(reset_bonobo_open_with_menu): remove menu items and verbs from
	context menu as well as normal menu.

	* components/adapter/nautilus-adapter-progressive-load-strategy.c:
	Increased chunk-size to 32k in an unsuccesful attempt to improve
	the situation with regards to fix bug 3256 (attempt to view huge
	text file is very slow). It did not help which leads me to believe
	the problem is with the way the text control handles progressive
	updates.

	Fix bug 2180 (switching from icon view to list view, the zoom
	control disappears and then reappears).
	
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c (load_content_view,
	zoom_level_changed_callback): Don't show and hide the zoom control
	at various times. Instead, let
	`nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget' establish the right
	visibility state when we finally enable the widget. This way, the
	zoom control won't ever disappear and reappear when switching
	between two different zoomable views.
	* src/nautilus-window.c (nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget):
	Set the zoom control to the right visibility state when setting
	the new widget.

	More progress on using Bonobo for context menu items.
	Now the Bonobo context menu items get their labels
	updated to match the selection.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(compute_menu_item_info):
	Now has return parameters for the label with & without underscore,
	instead of a boolean parameter to choose between them.	
	(append_gtk_menu_item), (append_selection_menu_subtree):
	Update callers that only want the without-underscore version.	
	(update_one_menu_item): Set the label for the verb (no underscore)
	as well as the label for the menu item (include underscore).

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:

	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:

	as well as the label for the menu item (include underscore).
	
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml:

	More work towards converting directory view context menus
	to use Bonobo. Checking in so Darin can help me debug.

	(fm_directory_view_pop_up_selection_context_menu): Add
	conditional to execute Bonobo version (if TRUE changed to FALSE).
	(fm_directory_view_pop_up_background_context_menu): formatting tweak.
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml:
	Added command definitions for all verbs. Moved labels from
	context items into commands. Moved tips into commands. Populated
	the background and selection popup menu definitions.
	* src/file-manager/nautilus-icon-view-ui.xml:
	Added command definitions for all verbs and ids. Defined labels

	* components/adapter/nautilus-adapter-progressive-load-strategy.c
	(call_when_stopped, load_and_free_uri, declare_done_loading,
	stop_loading,
	nautilus_adapter_progressive_load_strategy_load_location): Make
	sure previous load is completely stopped before ever starting a
	new load.

	* components/adapter/nautilus-adapter.c:

	signals to the view frame while in the middle of destroying the

	nautilus_tree_view_update_model_node): Set both open and closed
	pixmaps, so open folders have a disttinct appearance in the tree,
	in addition to the disclosure triangles. This fixes bug 2421. This
	work was needed to fix bug 3279 (Icons in tree sidebar panel don't
	update when theme is changed), which was a side effect of not
	doing this.

 	* components/tree/nautilus-tree-model.c
	(nautilus_tree_model_directory_files_added_callback): Check if we
	already have a node for each file before trying to create a new
	one. This was needed because otherwise chaning the preference
	settins mentioned above would result in crashes.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.h,
	libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_is_hidden_file, nautilus_file_is_backup_file,
	nautilus_file_should_show,
	filter_hidden_and_backup_partition_callback,
	nautilus_file_list_filter_hidden_and_backup): Move hidden file and
	backup file filtering logic here from fm-directory-view.c.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (queue_pending_files): Use
	`nautilus_file_list_filter_hidden_and_backup' to do filtering.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.h,
	libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-global-preferences.c
	(global_preferences_create_dialog, global_preferences_register):
	Add a new preference for showing only directories in the tree
	view.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-dialog.c: Make
	preferences dialog a bit bigger to accomodate the new setting.

2000-11-12  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug 3210, trash image fails to appear when defined as
	emblem, by disallowing new emblems to be defined with the same
	name as intrinsic ones.  Also, disallowed adding an emblem with
	the same name as an existing one.

	* src/nautilus-property-browser.c:
	(nautilus_property_browser_destroy), (emblem_keyword_valid),
	(is_reserved_keyword), (emblem_dialog_clicked),
	(make_properties_from_directories):
	maintain a glist of emblem names, and check it when we're adding a
	new one to make sure it's not already on it.  Put up an error dialog
	if it already exists.

	every time, whether or not we end up selecting it.
	(nautilus_tree_view_destroy): Free `current_main_view_uri' and
	`selected_uri' fields.
	(tree_select_row_callback): Only ignore the select if the selected
	row matches `current_main_view_uri', not just `selected_uri' to
	fix bug 4584 (Can not reselect the previous directory in the tree
	when I entered a "hidden" directory in the content view)

	(nautilus_tree_view_button_release): Only select the row on a
	release of button 1, otherwise ignore to fix bug 4503 ("Tree

	Fixed bugzilla.eazel.com bugs 4051 (applications which require
	terminals don't get them) and 4072 (mime types: command= string
	can't take args?).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gnome-extensions.c
	(nautilus_gnome_terminal_shell_execute): Don't take the shell as
	an argument, just use "/bin/sh", there's no reason to use any
	other shell for the purpose of launching a terminal like this.

	(nautilus_gnome_open_terminal): Don't pass user shell to
	`nautilus_gnome_terminal_shell_execute'; handle `gnome-terminal'
	properly by passing it "-x" instead of incorrectly trying to quote
	the command.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gnome-extensions.h: Fix minor
	typo.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.h,
	libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.c:
	(nautilus_launch_application_from_command): Add a use_termial
	argument and if passed, launch the program in a terminal; minor
	fixes to the way non-terminal-requiring programs are launched as
	well, including not quoting the command, so that it can include
	command line arguments (if the command name includes a space, it
	had better be quoted already).

	(nautilus_launch_application): Use the new `use_terminal' argument
	when calling `nautilus_launch_application_from_command'.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-chooser.c:
	(launch_mime_capplet): Use the new `use_terminal' argument
	when calling `nautilus_launch_application_from_command'.

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c
	(change_desktop_background_menu_item_callback): Use the new
	`use_terminal' argument when calling
	`nautilus_launch_application_from_command'.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c (activate_callback): Use
	the new `use_terminal' argument when calling
	`nautilus_launch_application_from_command'. Also, shell-quote the
	command, since nautilus_application_launch_from_command won't do
	that for you any more.

	(nautilus_property_browser_drag_data_get):

	Remove unnecessary calls to wait functions. There are still
	one or two cases of calls. Next step is to replace them.

2000-11-09  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	The beginnings of converting directory view context menus
	to Bonobo. This doesn't work right yet; I'm checking in

	(nautilus_icon_container_get_drop_action):
	fixed bug 3215 and 3723, bad feedback during emblem dropping,
	by rejecting the drop if we're not over an icon.  Also, made it
	reject the drop for colors and backgrounds if we're not over

	buddy: Gene Ragan <gzr@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: (rename_callback): Since
	metadata for the directory itself is now stored under a fixed
	name, no need to rename the metadata for self-owned files any
	more.
	(get_item_count), (get_size), (compare_directories_by_count),
	(compare_files_by_size), (compare_by_size): Reimplement compares
	by size so they don't use gnome_vfs_file_info_compare -- this
	makes them work better for info == NULL cases.
	(get_date), (compare_by_modification_date): Reimplement compares
	by modification date so they don't use gnome_vfs_file_info_compare
	-- this makes them work better for info == NULL cases.
	(compare_by_name): Sort files that start with "." or "#" last.
	(compare_by_name_and_directory_name): Helper function so that we
	always sort by directory name when names are equal.
	(nautilus_file_compare_for_sort): Use the new functions above so
	we never have to use the gnome_vfs_file_info_compare function.
	Because of that, we won't have to keep file names around any more.
	This also simplified the logic -- I was able to remove all the
	special cases for info == NULL.
	(get_metadata_name): Function that returns "." for self-owned
	files so the metadata for the directory itself is stored somewhere
	that's not affected by renaming.
	(nautilus_file_get_metadata), (nautilus_file_get_metadata_list),

2000-11-07  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Worked on getting rid of wait_until_ready.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c: Got rid of include
	of nautilus-wait-until-ready.h.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c: Got rid of
	nautilus_file_wait_until_ready.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-mime-actions.c:
	(wait_until_ready_callback),
	(nautilus_mime_actions_wait_for_full_file_attributes):
	Reimplemented so the wait is in here so we can get rid of
	nautilus_file_wait_until_ready.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-mime-actions.h: Moved
	nautilus_mime_actions_wait_for_full_file_attributes into
	nautilus-wait-until-ready.h.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-chooser.c: Added include
	of nautilus-wait-until-ready.h since this is one of the two files
	that still uses the thing.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-program-choosing.c: Added include
	of nautilus-wait-until-ready.h since this is one of the two files
	that still uses the thing.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-wait-until-ready.h: Removed
	nautilsu_file_wait_until_ready and added
	nautilus_mime_actions_wait_for_full_file_attributes.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(switch_location_and_view): Get rid of code that waits for
	attributes, because the code guarantees they will already be read
	at this point.
	(fm_directory_view_destroy): Stop monitoring the file for the open
	with menu.
	(files_changed_callback): Update the menus whenever a file changes
	or our knowledge about it changes.
	(create_open_with_gtk_menu): Use the new monitor call to arrange
	to get the information about the single selected file that we
	need.
	(reset_bonobo_open_with_menu): Use the new monitor call to arrange
	to get the information about the single selected file that we
	need.
	(activate_callback): Remove the hack to work around the
	wait_until_ready calls. Also remove the wait_until_ready in here
	because we now request all the attributes we will be needing in
	the call_when_ready call (that already existed).
	(fm_directory_view_activate_file): Request all the attributes
	needed for determining MIME actions.
	(monitor_file_for_open_with): New function to monitor the stuff we
	need to know for the Open with menu.
	
	* test/test-nautilus-mime-actions-set.c: (ready_callback), (main):
	Use call_when_ready instead of wait_until_ready.

	(emblem_dialog_clicked):
	fixed bugs 4168 and 4171, problems occur when slash and backslash
	are included in emblem names, by only allowing alphanumeric
	characters in emblem names and displaying an error dialog if
	that's not so.
	
2000-11-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* icons/villanova/villanova.xml:
	fixed the villanova theme to use the default document icons

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-operations.c:
	* src/nautilus-first-time-druid.h:
	Tweak to match Nautilus coding style.
	
	* src/nautilus-first-time-druid.c: (druid_cancel): Added FIXME
	about the way it quits Nautilus when you cancel.
	(druid_finished): Use #define constants instead of hard-coded
	URLs.

	(nautilus_first_time_druid_show), (download_callback),
	(read_file_handle_cancel_cover), (initiate_file_download): Got rid
	of "cheap workaround" for when the druid goes away; instead, we
	cancel the I/O.
	
	Other tweaks to be at least in the vicinity of Nautilus coding
	style.

2000-11-07  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* nautilus-installer/src/prescript: Make the installer run
	successfully when run as root instead of failing silently, as part
	of the fix to 4605. Sadly, when Eli tried installing as root with
	the modified installer it worked, but running Nautilus
	subsequently as root resulted in strange Nautilus behavior, so
	probably we can't call it closed.

2000-11-03  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.c:
	(add_to_url):
	Last fix broke the magic static link of the installer, this will
	fix.

2000-11-03  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4483 (Crash while navigating in Vault).

	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget):
	Remove the idle with gtk_idle_remove, not gtk_timeout_remove.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_destroy): Removed the check since it was giving
	false alarms and not helping us for real.

2000-11-03  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/nautilus-shell.c: (display_caveat): Lets call the main
	branch "Nautilus", not "Nautilus Preview Release 2". Later we
	should change the caveat for cvs to be worded differently too.

	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_constructed),
	(nautilus_window_set_arg), (nautilus_window_get_arg),
	(nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget): Fixed spaces removed
	by the script (forgot to save this file before committing before).

2000-11-03  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in:
	* helper-scripts/.cvsignore:
	* helper-scripts/Makefile.am:
	* helper-scripts/nautilus-verify-rpm.sh:
	Add a place to put helper-scripts.
	
	* helper-utilities/error-dialog/Makefile.am:
	Dont link in with Nautilus libraries and dependencies.
	
	* helper-utilities/error-dialog/nautilus-error-dialog.c:
	(find_message_label), (find_message_label_callback),
	(show_message_box), (show_ok_box), (nautilus_error_dialog),
	(nautilus_yes_no_dialog), (main):
	Add support for specifying button labels on the command line.
	
	* src/run-nautilus:
	Call the nautilus rpm verification script and bail if it fails.
	
2000-11-03  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* README: Tell everyone that we are back on bonobo HEAD.
	* configure.in: Make sure Nautilus doesn't try to compile with the
	old bonobo.
	
	* components/adapter/nautilus-adapter-embed-strategy.c:
	(nautilus_adapter_embed_strategy_get):
	* components/adapter/nautilus-adapter-load-strategy.c:

	* libnautilus/nautilus-undo.c: (set_up_bonobo_control):
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view.c: (view_frame_call_begin):
	* libnautilus/nautilus-zoomable.c:
	(nautilus_zoomable_ensure_zoomable_frame):
	Fix all the callers of query_interface in CORBA to call it
	queryInterface (I used the Bonobo script to do it).
	
	* src/nautilus-window.h:
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_constructed),
	(nautilus_window_set_arg), (nautilus_window_get_arg),
	(nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget): Update for BonoboWin ->
	BonoboWindow change. Once again, the change was done by the Bonobo
	script (but I had to undo the spaces it ate after BONOBO_WIN).
	
	* components/services/install/idl/trilobite-eazel-install.idl:
	* components/services/time/idl/trilobite-eazel-time-service.idl:
	* components/services/trilobite/idl/trilobite-service.idl:

	* libnautilus-adapter/nautilus-adapter-factory.idl:
	* libnautilus/nautilus-distributed-undo.idl:
	* libnautilus/nautilus-view-component.idl:
	Since IDL dependencies don't work, I touched every IDL file to
	make the switchover smoother. This only works if people update
	before they try to build and fail, otherwise they need to do:
		find -name '*.xml' | xargs touch
	(Maciej and I want to add dependency support to orbit-idl to make
	this problem go away long term).
	
	* src/nautilus-desktop-window.c: (realize):
	The script updated this comment to, so I let it.
	
	* user-guide/C/Makefile.am: Took out the botched change I made to
	this file. Mathieu did the correct one.

2000-11-03  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Hopefully, fix bug 4055 for true.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-list.c:
	(nautilus_list_drag_start), (nautilus_list_ensure_drag_data),
	(nautilus_list_drag_end), (nautilus_list_get_drop_action),
	(nautilus_list_drag_motion), (nautilus_list_drag_data_received):
	make it work with multiple successive drags by reinitializing a 
	number of variables used during drag.
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_receive_dropped_icons),
	(fm_list_get_default_action): make it react to drops in the blank
	area of a list view.

2000-11-03  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	(nautilus_rpm_view_install_done),
	(nautilus_rpm_view_install_package_callback):
	Made a last minute fix to the delete file signal change in the
	rpmview. The rpmview still cannot get the spinner to spin when
	installing/uninstalling, but I'm not going to use time on that
	now.

	* components/services/install/command-line/eazel-alt-install-corba.
	c: (install_failed):

	(draw_or_measure_label_text_aa), (draw_label_text_aa):
	fixed bug 4192, strange feedback while stretching icons, by using
	libart to draw the rectangle instead of the buggy custom graphics
	routine that we were using.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(icon_container_preview_callback):
	fixed bug 4460, remote sound files displayed preview icon but
	didn't actually preview, by adding a check to make it display
	the icon for local files only
	
	* src/nautilus-window-menus.c: (file_menu_new_window_callback):
	fixed bug 4033, new window command should initially point to the
	home directory by calling nautilus_window_go_home instead of going
	to the uri of the current window.
	
2000-11-03  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	(eazel_install_rpm_set_settings):
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-core-utils.c
	: (trilobite_add_log):

	Clean up debug mode (was missing some pieces) and set up the g_log
	handler to not work in corba mode (letting libtrilobite handle
	them in corba mode).  Make it start up as early as possible and
	let the service provide a file pointer for logging.

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c
	: (generate_summary_form):

	Make the giant label a little bit more palatable to Arlo.
	
	* nautilus-installer/src/installer.c: (log_debug),
	(add_bullet_point_to_vbox), (strip_categories),
	(start_over_make_category_func), (start_over),

	* nautilus-installer/src/installer.h:
	* nautilus-installer/src/link.sh:
	* nautilus-installer/src/main.c:
	* nautilus-installer/src/prescript:

	Use /tmp/eazel-install.log for logging (being very careful to make
	sure the file is not a booby trap) instead of spamming all over
	the terminal.  However, the --debug option will give you the
	terminal spam if you want it (in addition to the logfile).  Fix
	the annoying debug logs to use g_log so we can catch them.  Add a
	--batch option that causes the installer to skip all question
	screens.

2000-11-03  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	scripts to display errors to the user.

	* components/services/nautilus-dependent-shared/eazel-services-footer.c:

	fixed problem where I accidentally changed the icons for disk
	drives that appear on the desktop when I only meant to change
	the hardware view.  Fixed by restoring the old icon, and using
	one with a different name in the hardware view.
	
	* components/hardware/nautilus-hardware-view.c:
	(setup_overview_form):
	use "i-harddrive.png" instead of "i-blockdev.png"
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/i-blockdev.png:
	* icons/i-harddrive.png:

	a better version of the non-anti-aliased loading icon from Susan.
		
2000-11-01  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-mime-actions.c:
	(nautilus_mime_actions_file_needs_full_file_attributes,
	server_has_content_requirements,
	server_matches_content_requirements): New functions.

	(nautilus_mime_get_all_components_for_file) Updated.

	* src/nautilus-applicable-views.h,
	src/nautilus-applicable-views.c: (got_file_info_callback_common,
	(got_full_file_info_callback, got_minimum_file_info_callback,
	nautilus_navigation_info_new, nautilus_navigation_info_cancel):
	Changed to possibly handle calling the callback twice so we can
	avoid having to load twice before showing a component at all.

	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c
	(nautilus_window_end_location_change_callback): If being called a
	preliminary time, ignore it for now.

	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/libtrilobite.h:
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-redirect.c:
	* nautilus-installer/src/installer.c:
	
	Fix builtin uri's to point to a sane place by default.  Make the
	install view use your trilobite gconf config and not a made-up
	site (oops).  Remove leftover "eazel-auth:" uri.  Use good PR2
	defaults for the bootstrap installer.  Fix missing ellipses that
	were bothering Eli.

2000-11-01  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4335 (music view does not work with Services:Vault)

	* components/music/nautilus-music-view.oafinfo:
	Added the requirement that the URL must be file scheme, since
	the music view doesn't know how to deal with MP3s that are not
	on the local hard disk.

2000-11-01  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4343 (crash clicking "Back" deep in software catalog)

	This was an inaccurate assert. Other similar asserts had been
	fixed earlier, but this one and a parallel one in Forward got
	overlooked.

	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c:
	(check_bookmark_location_matches_uri): New helper function, uses
	uris_match.
	(check_last_bookmark_location_matches_window): Now calls the
	new function (which was extracted from this)
	(handle_go_back),
	(handle_go_forward): Use the new function to check that the bookmark
	has the right uri, instead of direct string compares.

2000-11-01  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* nautilus.spec.in: adding fdl.
	* user-guide/C/Makefile.am: adding installation of fdl
	* user-guide/C/fdl.sgml: adding fdl

2000-11-01  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4337, Title for nautilus user manual is "GNOME Documemtation"
	
	* user-guide/C/sgml/nautilus.sgml:
	Added "Nautilus User Manual" as <title> tag.
	
2000-11-01  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 4305 (Nautilus can't find myplay.com (default bookmark)
	URL). As Mike Fleming and Pavel suggested, changed NautilusFile to
	keep relative URIs around instead of file names. This may also fix
	two other Mozilla-component-related bugs, bug 3438 and 4220. I'll
	check that later.

	Also fix bugs 4128, 4311, and 4344, which are all about a hash
	table NULL critical assertion.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback): Handle info in the order it gets
	queued. That requires a call to g_list_reverse since we add things
	with g_list_prepend. Check for NULL to handle case where the info
	is not part of a directory load. Use the new
	nautilus_directory_find_file_by_name to keep it clearly separate
	from code that would find files given relative URIs.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: RIP
	nautilus_compare_file_with_name. We haven't used it since we've
	been using a hash table.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(add_to_hash_table): Put the relative URI in the hash table, not
	the name.
	(extract_from_hash_table): Look up in the hash table by relative
	URI, not name.
	(nautilus_directory_add_file), (nautilus_directory_remove_file):
	Assertions are based on the relative URI, not the name.
	(nautilus_directory_find_file_by_name): Turn the name into a
	relative URI and search for that.
	(nautilus_directory_find_file_by_relative_uri): Look up in the
	hash table by relative URI, not name.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: Replace the name
	field with a relative_uri field. There aren't always names for
	files.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_new_from_relative_uri): Mechanical changes to make
	it create a file given a directory and relative_uri. Uses the new
	update_info_and_name instead of the old nautilus_update_file_info
	(which no longer updates names).
	(nautilus_file_new_from_info). Use the new update_info_and_name
	instead of the old nautilus_update_file_info (which no longer
	updates names).
	(nautilus_file_get_internal): Call nautilus_uri_make_canonical on
	the URI before using it. This is needed now to make the escaping
	of characters in the relative URI uniform. Also made mechanical
	changes to deal with relative URIs instead of file names.
	(destroy): Always free the relative URI. We no longer share the
	name inside the file info, so the logic is now simpler.
	(nautilus_file_get_gnome_vfs_uri): Append the relative URI instead
	of appending a file name to make the full URI.
	(rename_callback): Use the new update_info_and_name instead of the
	old nautilus_update_file_info (which no longer updates
	names). Also call nautilus_find_file_by_name under its new name.
	(name_is): New helper function for checking the file name quickly
	without requiring a local variable.
	(nautilus_file_rename): Use name_is instead of strcmp since the
	name is no longer so readily available.
	(update_info_internal): Moved the guts of nautilus_file_update_info
	in here and made the name-updating part optional. Logic is a bit
	simpler since we don't share the name in the file info any more.
	(update_info_and_name), (nautilus_file_update_info): Covers that
	call the internal call with the "update_name" flag set.
	(nautilus_file_update_name): Use name_is and update_info_and_name.
	Also fix the info == NULL case to handle relative URIs, not names.
	(nautilus_file_compare_for_sort): Add a FIXME about using the name
	in the info when sorting. Also change the info == NULL case to get
	the names with nautilus_file_get_name.
	(nautilus_file_compare_name): Use nautilus_file_get_name to get
	the names to compare.
	(nautilus_file_get_metadata), (nautilus_file_get_metadata_list),
	(nautilus_file_set_metadata), (nautilus_file_set_metadata_list),
	(nautilus_file_get_boolean_metadata),
	(nautilus_file_get_integer_metadata),
	(nautilus_file_set_boolean_metadata),
	(nautilus_file_set_integer_metadata): Store metadata using the
	relative URI as the key instead of the name. This amounts to a
	minor metadata file format change.
	(nautilus_file_get_name): Create the name by unescaping the
	relative URI. If this fails, just return the relative URI
	itself. In some cases the URI instead of the name would represent
	a terrible error (but the unescaping will not fail in those
	cases), but in other cases we just need some kind of name.
	(nautilus_file_get_uri): Some broken code in here was just
	appending the name to the parent URI. Now it appends the relative
	URI so it's no longer broken.
	(get_description): Use the relative URI instead of the name in the
	warning message.
	(nautilus_file_mark_gone): Since we always keep the relative URI
	around now, can get rid of the logic that copies the name out of
	the file info for this case.
	(nautilus_file_dump): Since we already dump the URI, don't bother
	dumping the name any more.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-image.c: (render_buffer_pixbuf):

	(nautilus_self_check_file_utilities):
	Hook up new GnomeVFS "make canonical" calls to fix test cases
	Darin needed to work for the bug he is fixing.
	Switched the test cases to their intended values, now that they pass.
	Get rid of some crufty workarounds that weren't really needed
	after my previous fix to not add extra '//' to some URIs and
	removed the respective tests.

2000-11-01  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	This is completely useless but I needed a break from "usefull"

	* applets/launcher/nautilus-launcher-applet.c: (image_leave_event),

	nautilus only if you release the cursor without leaving the icon.

	he is doing.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-image.c: (render_buffer_pixbuf):

2000-10-30  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4057 (clicking the back button while opening a huge
	directory often crashes).
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c:
	(nautilus_icon_container_for_each): The function was iterating
	some icons twice. All the icons on the new_icons list are also on
	the icons list.
	(icon_destroy): Also be sure to remove the icon from the new_icons
	list if it happens to be destroyed while still on that list.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.shared:
	Got rid of the shared part of the code to generate .xml.h
	files. It's no longer needed since the po directory takes care of
	everything itself.
	
	* components/loser/content/Makefile.am:
	* components/loser/sidebar/Makefile.am:
	* components/mozilla/Makefile.am:
	* components/sample/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/Makefile.am:

	* src/file-manager/Makefile.am:

	files.

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c
	: (forgot_password_button_cb):

	Fixing Bug #4178.  The Help button was not working right.

2000-10-29  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c
	: (generate_login_dialog): Change "Please login to eazel services"
	to "Please log in to Eazel services", in two places.

2000-10-30  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c
	: (summary_load_location_callback):
	Add setting of window and sidebar title to the summary view
	to "Eazel Services Summary".  I'm not necessarily attached to the wording
	but we should definitely make it something other than "eazel".
	this fixes a bug I filed, #4183

2000-10-30  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/trilobite/helper/eazel-helper.pam:

	Yeah!  Found out how to let eazel-helper run even if root has
	no password set.  Add "nullok" to the pwdb line in the pam
	config file.

2000-10-30  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-utilities.c:
	(nautilus_make_uri_canonical),
	(nautilus_self_check_file_utilities):
	nautilus_make_uri_canonical was relying on GnomeVFSURI sort-of
	handling relative uris, even though they are illegal in GnomeVFS.
	My earlier fix in gnome-vfs "broke" some of this broken behavior. 
	Added more special-case handling of cryptic absolute to 
	nautilus_make_uri_canonical to make it behave like before and not
	break existing behavior that depends on it. Added some bandaids for
	conversions that are clearly wrong but that may need more work 
	throughout the code that depends on it, for now I'm making it
	behave like the old call.
	My earlier fix to gnome-vfs fixes 2803. Change the test to reflect 
	the correct behavior.

2000-10-30  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/trilobite/helper/README:
	* components/services/trilobite/helper/eazel-helper.security.in:

	Set fallback (in pam and usermode) to false: always needs to run
	as root.

2000-10-30  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c
	: (generate_eazel_news_entry_row):
	disabled the "use all the space" since it causes too much flashing
	during size negotiation.  I'll either fix the flashing or remove
	it from nautilus_label soon.
	
2000-10-29  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-label.c:
	(nautilus_label_initialize_class), (nautilus_label_size_allocate),
	(get_clipped_width), (label_recompute_line_geometries):
	made nautilus_label interpret a wrap width of -1 to mean "use
	all of the available space".
	
	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c
	: (generate_service_entry_row), (generate_eazel_news_entry_row),
	(generate_update_news_entry_row):
	made the news items use all of the available space by setting its
	wrap width to -1.
	
2000-10-29  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	: (generate_summary_form), (generate_eazel_news_entry_row),
	(authn_cb_succeeded), (authn_cb_failed):
	improved formatting of news items, now that we finally have a long
	one.  Also, removed some unconditional debugging messages.

	Fix the bootstrap installer for the delete_files call, and don't
	forget to delete the package list too.  Also, set forced-downgrade
	to TRUE until a post-PR2 bug is fixed.
	
2000-10-29  Mike Fleming  <mfleming@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c

	* src/nautilus-window-service-ui.c: (goto_online_storage),
	(goto_software_catalog), (detach_service_ui),
	(nautilus_window_install_service_ui):

	Go back to initing ammonite each time these menus are called.  
	I didn't want to bother with trying to make it work.

	Fix bug 4054 - fix nautilus GNOME menu item so it does not
	"crash" nautilus.

	Fix bug 4117 - change default for PR2 back to desktop off.

	Also fix the issue about turning off the gnome crash dialog for
	out of process components.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/nautilus-launch-icon.png:
	New launch icon from Arlo.

	* src/run-nautilus:
	Change this beast to not always run nautilus-clean.sh.  It only
	runs nautilus-clean.sh right before/after running Nautilus and not
	for every single invocation of 'run-nautilus'.  

	Also, dont start the desktop anymore, since there is not a
	preference in Nautilus to toggle the desktop.

	Finally, turn on the environment variable needed to prevent the
	gnome crash dialog from showing up for out of process components.
	
	* nautilus.desktop:
	Update icon and launch script back to run-nautilus.

	* nautilus.spec.in:
	We're back to using run-nautilus.

	Fixed bug 4087 (crash leaving Summary view)

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c: 
	(nautilus_summary_view_destroy): Don't unset container and unref
	component here; that's not necessary for the component that's
	created automagically. And doing so causes a double-destroy.
	(update_menu_items), (merge_bonobo_menu_items): Removed 
	ui_component field from details and changed callers to get the
	ui_component elsewise when needed (to clarify that it isn't
	owned here).
	* src/nautilus-service-ui.xml: Changed "Eazel Services" to
	"Eazel Services Home" since all the services are Eazel Services.
	* src/nautilus-service-ui.xml.h: gotta check this in too.

2000-10-27  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	overriden by command-line options.
	
2000-10-27  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bugs in file renaming. These changes along with the
	gnome-vfs ones take care of bug 3846 (cancel dialog persists after
	renaming online storage folder).

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_get_gnome_vfs_uri): Moved higher so it could be
	used by rename code.
	(operation_remove): Separated out the remove operation so we can
	remove the operation before the callback. This makes it safe to
	do a nautlius_file_cancel from inside a callback.
	(operation_free): Call the separate remove. Also cut down because
	we don't need so much state in the operation object any more.
	(operation_complete): Call remove before calling callback as
	described above.
	(rename_callback): A new callback that uses set_file_info results
	instead of the old one that used xfer.
	(nautilus_file_rename): Change to use set_file_info instead of
	xfer. Also updates the MIME type now, which will fix a bug I
	think.
	(nautilus_file_update_info): Use gnome_vfs_file_info_dup instead
	of gnome_vfs_file_info_ref so it works with any info, including
	static ones on the stack.
	(set_permissions_callback), (nautilus_file_set_permissions),
	(set_owner_and_group_callback), (set_owner_and_group): Change to
	use the info returned by the async. set_file_info. This simplifies
	things a lot.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-error-reporting.c: (rename_callback),
	(cancel_rename_callback), (cancel_rename), (fm_rename_file):
	Rewrote renaming code. Use object data to keep track of pending
	renames so we can cancel a previous one if we try to re-rename the
	same file again. This allowed the code to get a lot simpler too.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(directory_load_done): Fixed bug that prevented the directory from
	ever noticing files that are no longer around. This code never
	worked because we checked for the wrong error code (EOF means
	success here).
	
	* po/Makefile.in.in: Re-removed this file. Seth checked it in by
	accident. This is a generated file, not one that should be checked
	in.
	
	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_realize): Got rid of
	"//"-style comments and used #if 0 instead.

	pointless.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-utilities.c:
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-utilities.h:

	The URL will have to be updated again later, as the bug report says.

	(nautilus_make_uri_canonical): Return of the workaround to
	convert file://foo to file:///foo, marked with appropriate
	FIXME.
	(nautilus_uri_is_canonical_uri): Changed implementation to just
	call make_uri_canonical and compare. It had been doing a subset
	of the things that make_uri_canonical does, but it had gotten out
	of synch.
	(nautilus_self_check_file_utilities): Updated tests and added more.

2000-10-27  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

        * components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/gdb3html.[ch]:
        Added a 'base_path' to the Context struct

	This introduces the problem thingy to libeazelinstall. A set of

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-container.c: (destroy),

	icon_destroy and putting it into the widget's destroy method like
	it should have been.  This also could have been hurting performance
	and causing other weird problems.

	Trickery to make the eazel-helper.security file be build during

	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-core-distrib

	gnome-vfs.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback):
	Did some refactoring to stop an assertion in NautilusDirectory
	add_to_hash_table from firing. This involved removing two lists

	list is being used and the condition that causes the assertion (duplicate
	files in the hash table) is not being created.

	Factor out the bullet point generation and make it line-wrap

	better debugging on failed package lists.

	Fixed the panel menu item to launch the desktop
	and one nautilus window, starting at the user's 
	home directory by default.  To do this, we created
	a new script called launch-nautilus.  Ramiro 
	recommended some changes to run-nautilus that
	I also did.

	* nautilus.desktop:
	Changed run-nautilus to launch-nautilus
	* nautilus.spec.in:
	Changed run-nautilus to launch-nautilus,
	since run-nautilus won't be needed in the
	rpm

	l-view.c: (generate_install_form), (show_dialog_and_run_away):

	A few quick tweaks to make the installer screenshot-worthy, and to
	fix a possible case where it would switch to a new URI before it
	had told nautilus it was done loading.  (I think that was
	confusing Nautilus in some corner cases.)

	Fix bugzilla.eazel.com 3949.  Better (but still not perfect) 
	support for relative URI's.  The cases that aren't handled are rarely
	encountered in my experiance.  I'd make it perfect, but I just

	: (generate_summary_form), (generate_service_entry_row),

2000-10-24  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/rsvg.c: Implemented the "opacity" property for objects
	and groups. This makes rsvg render more SVG files exported from
	Adobe Illustrator 9 correctly and should make Arlo happy.

	* librsvg/opacity.svg: New test file including opacity examples.

2000-10-24  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

2000-10-24  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-glib-extensions.c:

	* data/static_bookmarks.xml
	Updated bookmarks list to current links

2000-10-24  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Some work towards reducing load_directory calls.

	Also fixed bug 3978 (Many Bonobo warnings/errors on quit).

	(nautilus_mime_set_short_list_applications_for_file),
	(nautilus_mime_set_short_list_components_for_file):
	Get rid of the distinction between slow and default MIME type once
	again. We (Pavel, Maciej, John, and I) decided it's better not to
	have multiple opinions on the MIME type, despite our original idea
	that we needed the slow MIME type for some things, even on remote
	file systems.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-glib-extensions.h:
	Fixed the formatting in this file.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: (load_location_callback):
	Only force a reload if we are reloading the same directory. This
	is needed to take advantage of the loading already done for us by
	the framework.
	(load_directory): Take a NautilusDirectory instead of a URI string.
	Also take a boolean parameter to control if we force a reload.
	(finish_loading_uri): Respect the boolean parameter that tells us
	whether to force a reload.
	(filtering_changed_callback): Use the new load_directory.
	
	* src/nautilus-applicable-views.c: (nautilus_navigation_info_new),
	(nautilus_navigation_info_cancel), (nautilus_navigation_info_free):
	Monitor the directory while we are loading the component. We
	already need to load the directory to get the MIME types, so this
	does no additional harm, and it prepares us to consolidate the
	loading done for different reasons.
	
	* src/nautilus-main.c: (main): Use nautilus_setenv instead of
	putenv, since it's more portable.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c: Quick simplification pass on
	state machine. Got rid of the use of varargs and renamed a bunch
	of things.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-manage-views.h:
	* src/nautilus-window-private.h:
	Moved external functions from nautilus-window-manage-views.c to
	all be in nautilus-window-manager-views.h. This is one step in
	reducing the number of clients that need access to private stuff
	in NautilusWindow.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-service-ui.c: (detach_service_ui),
	(nautilus_window_install_service_ui): Detach the service UI on
	"destroy" rather that using set_data_full, because finalize time
	is too late.

	* src/nautilus-view-frame.c: (nautilus_view_frame_destroy):
	Got rid of extra unref that was messing things up here.
	
2000-10-24  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* components/mozilla/nautilus-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(uris_are_equal), (nautilus_mozilla_content_view_load_uri):
	Fix for bug 3908.  Browsing to web documents deeper than the root
	is broken.  I fixed it by backing out my previous broken fix for
	"reloading" a web page.  There is a separate bug for the reload
	issue which ill fix properly later.
	
2000-10-24  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* configure.in:
	Make the require rpm version be 3.0.4 or greater.  Not just 3.0.4.
	
2000-10-24  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	added new certified emblem from Susan

2000-10-23  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-operations.c:
	(parse_previous_duplicate_name),
	(nautilus_self_check_file_operations):
	Fix 3971 - "duplicate" from context-click menu adds space to
	beginning of the name.
	This was a case of misinterpretting files such as ".bashrc" as
	an extension.
	Added tests that catch this problem and fixed it. 

2000-10-24  Josh Barrow  <josh@eazel.com>

	* nautilus.spec.in:
	Make it require 3.0.4 or *greater*.  I'm using 3.0.5 and it 
	works fine.

	(add_update_package), (toggle_button_toggled),
	(eazel_installer_add_category), (eazel_installer_do_install):

	add <EXCLUSIVE/> tag to categories in package-list.xml to indicate
	that a category can't be selected with any other category (it's
	mutually exclusive with them).  added puppet-strings to the
	bootstrap installer to support that.
	
2000-10-23  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* user-guide/C/Makefile.am:
	Fixing tinderbox build.
	
2000-10-23  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* configure.in:

	up, feel free to revert.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-private.h:
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-object.c:

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-query.c:

	(nautilus_summary_view_initialize),
	(nautilus_summary_view_destroy):

	Store previously used Eazel Service user for later.  The ammonite
	login dialog makes use of this as the default username.
	

2000-10-23  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.c:
	(packagedata_fill_from_rpm_header):

	Fix a few warnings that show up on older rpmlibs.

2000-10-23  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	Last part of fix to 2989 - Disk thrashing on Nautilus startup.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-trash-directory.c: (add_volume):
	When starting up, don't try to create a Trash up-front, just search
	for existing Trash directories. The first time Nautilus ever runs,
	this will still take the same ammount of time, the next time it
	will use the cached entries.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_can_move_file_to_trash):
	Trash monitor no longer creates Trash directories on startup.
	Create them lazily when trying to move an item to the Trash.

2000-10-23  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* user-guide/C/Makefile.am: make it install files for real...

2000-10-23  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1945, Image viewer component does not display XPMs

	(load_image_from_stream):
	Fixed some leaks and call close on the loader to fix TIFF and XPM loading.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.c:
	(nautilus_gdk_pixbuf_load):
	Now it does. Loader must be closed to cause callbacks an non-progressive
	loaders to complete.

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.c:
	(packagedata_fill_from_rpm_header):
	Fixed a couple of build breaking unitilaized variable warnings.
	
	* components/tree/nautilus-tree-view.c:

	(eazel_installer_do_install), (eazel_installer_initialize):
	* nautilus-installer/src/link.sh:
	
	Reduce category description text to 10pt and adjust the layout to
	match Arlo specs.  Change g_message's to LOG_DEBUG just to annoy
	Eskil (actually, so we can turn them on/off easily with --debug).

	Added that we require rpm 3.0.4 if --enable-eazel-service

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.c:

	* src/nautilus-window.c:
	(nautilus_window_set_content_view_widget): Updated the debugging

2000-10-23  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c

	at Arlo's urging, I removed the emblem scale pinning that was added

	make the emblems a more reasonable size.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c:

	Fixed bug 3548 (modal error dialog is flakey in summary view)

	I made a bunch of small improvements to this file. Most of
	these had been checked in earlier but accidentally clobbered,
	but there are some new ones too.

	* components/services/summary/nautilus-view/nautilus-summary-view.c:
	Removed feedback_text field from details struct. This was used in
	an unnecessary and leak-inducing way before.
	(generate_summary_form): Remove period following exclamation point
	in on-screen text.
	(error_dialog_retry_cb): Removed this function.
	(set_dialog_parent): New helper function to parent a dialog on
	the NautilusSummaryView's window.
	(generate_error_dialog): Removed "Retry" button since it is 
	extremely unlikely to work, thus resulting in constant frustration;
	Removed initialized but unused "reply" variable; removed extra 
	initialization of "dialog" variable; use OK button instead of
	Cancel since there's only one button now; set up error message
	with parameter instead of details field; set text justification
	and line wrap to accommodate longer messages; parent the dialog
	so it doesn't appear in some random place.
	(authn_cb_failed): pass message to generate_error_dialog directly;
	removed unnecessary capital letter in message.
	(generate_login_dialog): remove initialized but unused "reply" variable;
	change "Please Login" to "Please log in"; parent the dialog.
	(nautilus_summary_view_load_uri): collapse a lot of identical code;
	improve error messages; display error message when xml file couldn't
	be parsed (was supposed to before, but wasn't); only generate the
	summary form if xml file was parsed.

2000-10-20  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>
	Fix for bug 1768, to put a hard limit on
	the number of files for PR2.  We do this 
	by keeping a count of confirmed files
	in directories, and stopping a load once the confirmed 
	file count reaches a certain level.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(nautilus_directory_add_file), (nautilus_directory_remove_file),
	(nautilus_directory_file_list_length_reached):
	increment and decrement file counts here when a file is added.
	A file is always confirmed when it is initially added, so 
	increment always, but only decrement the count when we are 
	removing a confirmed file.
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.h:
	Add function nautilus_directory_file_list_length_reached
	as public 
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(check_for_directory_hard_limit), (done_loading):
	when we finish loading the directory, display the hard limit
	dialog if necesssary, to let the user know we've stopped the directory
	load to prevent nautilus from overloading.

	setting the pixbuf data will have no effect.  Either the verb for 
	the item has to be set with the data or the item has to have
	its XML contructed  with the pixbuf type and data included in it
	at creation time. I have opted for the latter choice.

	Begin the slightly distateful process of adding special-case uri
	scheme icons to the left panel: make the install view use the RPM

	icons with uri schemes.

2000-10-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3839 (want Nautilus User Manual menu item)
	Note that this menu item does not actually work, due
	to bug 3876.

2000-10-18  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* configure.in:
	If no bonobo-ui-extract, AC_MSG_ERROR rather then cryptic failure
	during compile.
	
	* libnautilus/Makefile.am:
	Removed some evil blankspace

	* po/POTFILES.in
	Had to remove nautitlus-mozilla-ui.xml.h, since it's a conditional
	build, and eg. is not built on tinderbox.eazel.com. Better fix
	will have to come later, need new rpms' in softcat.

	* src/nautilus-main.c: (main):

2000-10-19  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* */Makefile.am: Feeble attempt to hook up generation
	of .h files from the *-ui.xml files to get them included
	in the translations. This will need to be done in a better
	way I guess.
	* configure.in: Added a check for bonobo-ui-extract.

2000-10-18  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/nautilus-simple-search-bar.c:
	(nautilus_simple_search_bar_new):
	Use calls by new names.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-undo-signal-handlers.c:
	(editable_key_press_event), (nautilus_undo_editable_set_undo_key):
	Disabled the undo-key part of undo also. The old code was actually
	harmless because it got the name of the signal wrong, but it's
	better to have it disabled.
	* src/nautilus-shell-ui.xml: Added a comment that points out the
	2nd place where undo has been disabled.

	(disconnect_set_up_in_control_handlers):
	Some minor cleanup of the clipboard code. Includes bug fixes for
	items that are already in focus when the clipboard is hooked up
	(should never happen), and a fix for code that was using
	gtk_signal_disconnect on something that was connected with
	gtk_signal_connect_while_alive (doesn't work). Also got rid of
	misguided code that was copying a Bonobo_UIContainer with memcpy
	(since Bonobo_UIContainer is just a pointer).
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/nautilus-window-private.h:
	Changed source file name from nautilus-service-menu to
	nautilus-service-ui, since it does a toolbar item, not just a
	menu.
	
	* src/nautilus-window-service-ui.c:
	* src/nautilus-window-service-ui.h:
	A second cut at the service UI code. It no longer leaks a UI
	component.

	* src/nautilus-window.c: (nautilus_window_constructed),
	(nautilus_window_get_ui_container): Use our own pointer to the UI
	container instead of asking the shell UI for its container.

2000-10-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3862 (Icon view reversed after looking at list view)
	Fixed bug 916 (workaround for Bonobo radio item bug)
	Also fixed bug where the "tighter layout" and "reversed order"
	items in the context menu were doing nothing at all.

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	Removed "updating_toggle_menu_item" from Details struct.
	(set_tighter_layout): New helper function, handles the code
	common to the Bonobo and GTK menu callbacks.
	(gtk_tighter_layout_callback), (gtk_sort_reversed_callback),
	New functions used for GTK context menu. Will go away when 
	we use Bonobo for context menus.
	(tighter_layout_state_changed_callback),
	(sort_reversed_state_changed_callback): Use passed state value,
	including checking for empty state (empty state happens when
	component is removed from container). This lets us eliminate the
	checks for "updating_toggle_item".	
	(handle_radio_item): Removed check for updating_toggle_menu_item.
	This already worked correctly without this check.
	(insert_one_context_menu_item),	(append_one_context_menu_item),
	(append_one_toggle_context_menu_item): Tweaked these to pass in
	an initial toggle state for toggle menu items, to avoid setting
	the toggle state after the callback has been attached. All this
	code will be removed when we switch to Bonobo for context menus.
	(fm_icon_view_create_selection_context_menu_items),
	(fm_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items),
	(update_layout_menus):

2000-10-18  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-preferences-item.c:
	(preferences_item_create_font_family):
	Remove the fixed font from the list of available fonts.  Its a bad
	one to use because it crashes the SideBar sometimes.  The problem
	is that the fixed font doesnt support the "find the largest
	fitting font" game that the SideBar plays for long strings.

	Its kinda lame to fix the bug by yanking the font, but we have
	many font improvements planned for after PR2 which will render
	this issue irrelevant.

	Fixes bug 2256.
	
2000-10-18  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.c: (rsvg_ft_measure_or_render_string),
	(rsvg_ft_render_string), (rsvg_ft_measure_string):
	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.h:
	Add new function to only measure a string without doing all the
	rendering work.
	
	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-scalable-font.c:
	(nautilus_scalable_font_measure_text):
	Use the new rsvg_ft string measuring api.

	Fixes bug 2544.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-icon-factory.c: (embed_text):
	* src/nautilus-zoom-control.c: (draw_number):
	Use gdk_fontset_load() instead of gdk_font_load() to make i18n
	work better.  Also marked some hard-coded fonts fot localization.
	There is still an open bug on writing useful comments about these
	for the localizers.  Fixes bugs 3143 and 3144.

	Thanks to Yukihiro Nakai <ynakai@redhat.com> for pointing these
	problems out and providing patches to fix them.
	
	* src/nautilus-profiler.c: (window_print_button_callback),
	(window_save_button_callback), (dump_dialog_new),
	(dump_dialog_show):
	Same as above plus mark some strings for localization and add
	assertions to currently unimplemented functions.
