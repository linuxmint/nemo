Exec=<myaction.py -r -g %P %F %U>

# Icon name to use in the menu - must be a theme icon name

# defined, the Stock-Id takes precedence.
#Stock-Id=gtk-cdrom

# What type selection: [s]ingle, [m]ultiple, any, notnone, none (background click), or
# a number representing how many files must be selected to display.
# ****** REQUIRED *******
Selection=m

# What extensions to display on - this is an array, end with a semicolon
# Single entry options, ending in a semicolon:
#     "dir" for directory selection
#     "none" for no extension.
#     "nodirs" for any selection, but not including directories.
#     "any" for any file type, including directories.
# Individual specific extensions can be a semicolon-terminated list
# Extensions are NOT case sensitive.  jpg will match JPG, jPg, jpg, etc..
# **** EITHER EXTENSIONS OR MIMETYPES IS REQUIRED *****
Extensions=any;

# What mime-types to display on - this is an array, end with a semicolon
# **** EITHER EXTENSIONS OR MIMETYPES IS REQUIRED *****

# in the exec line.  Optional - if you leave this out, a space is inserted.
# Note you can have trailing spaces here.
#Separator=, 

# Quote type to use (if any) - enclose paths/urls with quotes.  Optional - defaults
# to no quotes.  
# Can be:  single, double, backtick
#Quote=double

# Dependencies - program executables required for this action to work.  Nemo will
# Search in the path for these program(s) and not display the action if any are missing.
# You can also supply an absolute path to a file (i.e. /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-archive) to check
# instead of or in addition to an executable in the path.
# This is an array, separate entries with semi-colon, and terminate with a semicolon.
#Dependencies=gedit;

# Conditions - semicolon-separated array of special conditions:
#     "desktop" current (parent) folder is desktop
#     "removable" target (first selection) is removable
#     "gsettings <schema> <boolean key>"  is true
#     "gsettings <schema> <key> <key-type> <[eq|ne|gt|lt]> <value>"
#     "dbus <name>" exists
#     "exec <program>" run program and check its exit code (0 is pass, non-0 is fail).
#                      Enclose in < > if the program resides in the action's folder.

#Conditions=desktop;

# Escape Spaces - set to true to escape spaces in filenames and uris ($U, $F, $P, $D)
#
# Sometimes this may be preferred to getting raw filenames that must be enclosed in
# quotes.
#
# Optional - by default this is false

EscapeSpaces=true

# Run in terminal - set to true to execute the Exec line in a spawned terminal window.
#
# Generally if you use this you should not have Quotes defined, as that will be taken care
# of during converting the expanded command string into an arg vector.
#
# Optional - by default this is false

#Terminal=false
