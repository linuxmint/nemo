/* NemoSignaller is a class that manages signals between
   disconnected Nemo code. Nemo objects connect to these signals
   so that other objects can cause them to be emitted later, without
   the connecting and emit-causing objects needing to know about each
   other. It seems a shame to have to invent a subclass and a special
   object just for this purpose. Perhaps there's a better way to do 
   this kind of thing.
