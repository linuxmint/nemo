  * icon view: remove some deprecated paths (gtk doesn't return anything useful anymore.)
  * nemo-icon-canvas-item.c: Insert some space between the icon and label bounds in compact view.

  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: skip default placement if we're in auto-layout mode.  We get false lazy flags on new icons since the original desktop did not use auto-layout.  We need to handle this because we both store layout timestamps and provide auto-layout.

nemo (3.4.3) sonya; urgency=medium

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * Remove decoration from desktop window (shows in weston)

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Desktop: Relax control of positioning for placed icons.  At startup, they are loaded and set to their stored position, but not force-aligned, allowing the layout to ignore fluctuations in the work area during system startup.  Fix some logic around 'orphan' icons as well to prevent issues with icons not being shown due to being falsely classified as orphans.
  * icon container: Be more specific about when to flag icons coming from a different monitor due to a desktop configuration change. (see previous commit)
  * metadata: Add back cached position values in NemoFile.  Be sure to clear the timestamp metadata on files being moved/copied to or from the desktop. This ensures the lazy flag operates correctly.  With the desktop becoming a separate process, transfers that include position info need to be handled slightly differently, as the old way of just setting metadata and reacting to it from a new container won't work - the file gets debuted in the other process sooner than (or not reliably after, at least) the metadata is written, resulting in inconsistent positioning.
  * Add gvfs-info action for inspecting file metadata (for purposes of debugging) - right-click a file and it will send gvfs-info output on that file to stdout.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: improve updates after thumbnail generation.

nemo (3.4.2) sonya; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * nemo-icon-container.c: don't force a native window for the desktop - fixes prelight hover sticking on the desktop when leaving an icon to pass into another window.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container: don't show bracketed empty spots, it's tacky.
  * nemo-main.c: remove backend requirement (only needed for the desktop)
  * icon view/desktop: Fix hidpi scaling on the desktop.  This also fixes compact view mode in hidpi, which was semi-broken since hidpi was implemented, and very broken since the desktop grid was added.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: depopulate the dnd grid of the selected icons so insertion marks aren't drawn in the icon's source position.
  * nemo-window-manager-views.c: simple close the window if the current view has no backward history, instead of jumping home or to the parent folder.  The most common time for this to occur is a folder opened from the desktop - if you delete that folder, the window showing it then shows the desktop in a folder, which doesn't make much sense.
  * nemo-window-manage-views.c: invalidate file info before reloading the view, not after.  This fixes mount permissions being incorrect.
  * dnd: Restore capability of 'moving' files from and to the desktop via drag and drop.
  * Fetch file-roller mimetype info from a GDesktopAppInfo at startup, instead of a static (and woefully out of date) list.
  * nemo-file.c: followup to previous commit, retain the old mimetype list for fileroller in the event that, for some reason, there is no .desktop file installed for file-roller.  Also added application/x-xz-compressed-tar to the static list.
  * nemo-file.c: add EFAULT as a valid exception to the access_ok function.  This can throw when the file has just been moved or is in the midst of being moved and the internal async updates have not completed yet (usually during a fairly large transfer.)  As a result, the icon cache problem bar appears needlessly.
  * desktop: size thumbnails more appropriately - scale them to our icon size in height only, and allow the width to increase as much as our max text width while maintaining the image aspect ratio.
  * desktop thumbnails: Pad the thumbnail height when it ends up smaller than the desired height due to aspect ratio and width restrictions.  This ensures a nice alignment when keep-aligned is active.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: highlight the current dnd rectangle in debug mode.
  * desktop grid: use the layout size for determining constraint to the canvas bounds instead of max size - this prevents files with very long names from being pushed out of the grid alignment.
  * misc: Clean up minor leaks, other issues.
  * desktop grid: include additional text (Icon Captions) in calculations for the ellipsis limit, and update the desktop when these change - instead of forcing the user to reload or restart to see changes.
  * cleanup some warnings from recent commits.
  * nemo-style-application: Remove drop shadow from the selection and pre-light states of desktop icons.  The shadows are drawn outside the calculated bounds of these items, and are problematic to account for without doing frequent full screen repaints (something I want to avoid)
  * DnD: Draw the highlight box around the entire text when an item is prelit and highlighted as a drop target.  The highlight box was only drawing as if to surround only the normal, ellipsized text, rather than the full, unellipsized height.
  * Set a default font for the desktop - this is overridden by distros in most cases, but having something is better than leaving it blank - you could set it to "Unicorn poo 15" and it would still show the labels, even though you lack that actual font.
  * Add a default to our theme - using the default font was always supposed to be a fallback option, however the check in various places for whether the gsettings key is empty or not is incorrect - g_settings_get_string will always return a string, never NULL, so we need to check if the string is not empty instead. (I left the null check also as a safety - it's possible during startup that this may be null prior to the setting being first fetched.
  * desktop: Fix missing icons when 'show orphans' is disabled (we were incorrectly interpreting a monitor number of -1 (which means, no previous location) and a missing monitor.
  * Fix visual sort function - sort function was incorrect for the new grid, and the new order was never set after a sort when running the alignment routine.

  * Fix dnd for netscape url drops.
  * nemo-file-operations: limit metadata setting to desktop location only (In a previous commit it was re-enabled, but has the potential to cause traffic jams in dbus during a long copy/move operation.
  * nemo-mime-actions.c: Don't fail for non-local links (like dragged website links) - the check here is for the foreign url, not the local desktop file (link), so it will never succeed, and is not necessary.
  * DnD: Fix some positioning issues with auto-align local moves, and non-local icon moves (like nemo->nemo-desktop transfers)
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: keep the icon list synced with the visual order of the desktop.
  * dnd: split out some container-specific code that had bled over a bit
  * Fix application css - font was breaking Gtk 3.22 and is not needed. Change prelight to hover to fix deprecation warnings.

  * nemo-file.c: Only append .desktop to desktop files when they actually need it.  Trusted desktop files (ones that typically get made and placed on the desktop) don't show their extension, so when you try to rename them, the new name needs .desktop appended to it.
  * nemo-file-management-properties.glade: improve the description of the click-to-rename feature.
  * nemo-thumbnails.c: Don't set a stack size - see:
  * nemo-application.c: Look for already-existing desktop windows before attempting to manage the desktop.
  * desktop: Don't rebuild the desktop any time _NET_WORKAREA changes - this can happen fairly frequently in some situations, causing crashes due to the asynchronous nature of nemo's directory loading back-end.
  * eel-gnome-extensions.c: Use preferred terminal emulator when using "Run in terminal" to execute something.  This more or less reverts a75c26d50bba3fec1dc242b9efc03f37a06e7093 but simplifies it somewhat, adapting the function that is used in GDesktopAppInfo and adding a check for our user setting.
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: run layout_changed when the widget scale factor changes.  This (hopefully) handles regressions with hidpi support due to https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/commit/c5a513468ee8c3497f0673e3ca019ccd3f409f8b.

  * nemo-file-operations.c: Handle NULL NemoFiles when deciding queue - this happens in both directions when dragging/copying files to and from a Virtualbox guest or host.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Removed context menu option from preferences

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Thu, 12 Nov 2015 09:38:15 +0000

nemo (2.8.3) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Add control to context menu to toggle simple/complex menu
  * nemo-list-view: Implement click-to-rename
  * remove nemo-directory-view-ui-light.xml (no longer needed)

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Updated pot file

nemo (2.8.2) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * file operations queue: refactor slightly to make it easier to manage what gets queued and what gets started immediately.
  * nemo-window-pane.c: prevent search from appearing on desktop
  * preferences: move context menu toggle to the top of the Display page
  * file operations window: raise the window when another operation is added, if the window is visible (not status-iconed).
  * click-to-rename: move logic to earlier in the click event, in a way similar to how double-clicks are handled.  Also, handle the preference change in nemo-view - this way it can be re-used later to handle list views as well.  Also, this keeps us from interacting with GSettings so much.
  * icon view: fetch click-to-rename preference when the view is loaded, don't allow click-to-rename on read-only files.
  * thumbnails: detect and throttle back thumbnail generation for files that are being actively updated on disk.
  * file queue: Add some additional checks for determining whether or not to start a file operation immediately.
  * Add option to disable queueing
  * job queue: Refactor to reduce duplication, add debugging info, add filesystem comparison to detect false "local" paths (local paths to non-local or non-native filesystems and mounts).
  * nemo-query-editor: fix some casts to prevent build warnings.
  * click-to-rename: Fix accidental rename triggering with multiple selection in icon view
  * click-to-rename: Fix previous commit (broke double-click upon initial selection.)
  * list view: Don't clear the rename widget twice

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Fixed nemo crashing when quickly clicking on two unmounted volumes in the sidebar

nemo (2.8.1) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * nemo-list-view.c: Fix editable not being destroyed after a canceled rename in certain instances.  This would cause the action bindings for cut/copy not to be released from the text entry box, breaking cut/copy/paste until nemo was restarted.
  * src/nemo-extension-config-widget.c: Make "No extensions found" un-clickable like the other two lists.  (Would crash nemo when clicked)

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Mon, 26 Oct 2015 11:44:59 +0000

nemo (2.8.0) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Daniel Schürmann ]
  * pathbar: use a private struct and use use nemo_is_[home/root/desktop]_directory()
  * Fix compile errors
  * Don't use hardcoded script and action paths, remove unused sys script path
  * Used definitions from nemo-global-preferences
  * Moved action key definition to nemo-action.h to be external usable
  * Show comment as tooltips for actions in action config, and improve comments for some actions.
  * all: remove nemo_window_slot_go_to()
  * Combine the search bar and query editor
  * Added search_is_not_empty, to fixe a segfault in treelist

  [ Jonathan DePrizio ]
  * Only include the domain if the method is SMB

  [ Monsta ]
  * bumped some deps and build-deps

  [ AlirezaNaghizadeh ]
  * quick rename

  [ pyecs ]
  * Fix default sort order bug in list view

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix a couple of drag-and-drop issues when there are no bookmarks, or when the xdg-bookmark area is empty.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix a memory leak.
  * connect-to-server: remember the last connection type.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Fix column sorting when default sort type is "Detailed type"
  * nemo-connect-server-dialog.c: Fix previous commit.
  * fix build warning, missing prototype.
  * Fix some build warnings
  * nemo-window-pane.c: Fix crash during location entry.
  * fix indentation

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Don't assign the position of the last closed window to the first opened window (it would be really confusing if it worked.. and it didn't really work since gtk_application_get_windows() seemed to also count the desktop window)
  * Prefs: Rephrase quickrename option
  * nemo-action-config-widget.c: Localize non-localized comment string
  * Updated pot file

  [ Corbin ]
  * Re-add revealer animation on search bar
  * Fix Query Editor Row not displaying

nemo (2.6.7) rafaela; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * progress window: simplify slightly, have info widgets manage themselves more, to prevent having a race condition at certain stages of the file operation.

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Mon, 22 Jun 2015 23:35:49 +0200

nemo (2.6.6) rafaela; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Switch from .svg to .png format for the file operation tray icon. Scalable/symbolic isn't supported in gtk 3.12(+?)
  * open-with dialog: Fix focus and user interaction issues - - Focus defaults to the custom entry box - Enter key (or double-clicking in the list) will now 'OK' the dialog,   and open the file with either the selected program, or the custom   command. - The ok button now greys out if there is an invalid custom entry - Removed misleading program-picker button label and image.
  * preferences: tweak style a bit to match c-s
  * nemo-extensions-list: Don't hardcode lib path
  * nemo-view, nemo-sidebar: quiet warnings when looking for network locations

nemo (2.6.5) rafaela; urgency=medium

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * add runtime requirement for libcinnamon-desktop4

  [ mtwebster ]
  * Fix a couple build warnings
  * nemo-application: register with org.gnome.SessionManager - this should fix the race condition where c-s-d dies before nemo does, causing all of our icons to revert to fallbacks briefly.

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Wed, 27 May 2015 10:25:57 +0200

nemo (2.6.4) rafaela; urgency=medium

nemo (2.6.2) rafaela; urgency=medium

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Gettext fix: Due to genre/plural, in many languages, adjectives are not translatable on their own. They need to relate to a noun.
  * Gettext: Simplified msgids in file operation queue to make them easier to translate
  * Updated pot

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Adapt Nemo to deal with problem situations with the user thumbnail cache: - Added --fix-cache command line option (must be run as root) - Added quick check at startup to detect major problems and disable thumbnailing   until fixed. - Individual thumbnailed files are checked on the fly for permission issues. - When a problem is detected, an infobar appears, offering to fix the problem, or   ignore it.
  * Have 'dismiss' last for Nemo's lifespan.
  * thumbnails: Remove an orphan comment from previous commits, fix wording of the --fix-cache command-line option.
