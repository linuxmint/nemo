Development: 1/22/2013:

- Breadcrumbs:  Stylable by themes, see src/nemo-styles-fallback.css for default style information.
                Border radius, color, background color, and text color can be customized through that.

- Sidebar Disk Indicators:  Stylable by themes, again, see src/nemo-styles-fallback.css for default
                style information - you can customize the two colors (fore- and background), the
                thickness of the bar, the corner radius, the maximum length of the bar, and an amount
                of extra padding from the bottom of the cell.
